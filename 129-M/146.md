# All claims may revert if reward is equal to fee amount for any single reward

## Summary

If a reward token is revert-on-zero-transfer and the fee is ever equal to the reward amount for a claim, then that claim will revert. The protocol will lose fees and the user will be unable to process the rest of their claims, even aside from the 0 claim. This is because all internal and external rewards are claimed at once. If any one of them fail then the entire claim fails.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L623-L648

When `reward - fee = 0`, a zero transfer is made. Some tokens revert on zero transfers. This will revert the entire claim process.

## Impact

Users are unable to claim rewards and protocol does not receive fees.

## Recommendation

Skip transfer calls if the amount is zero.
