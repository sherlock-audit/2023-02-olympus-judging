# Vault will not be removed in certain case

## Summary
If a duplicate vault address has been added then removing vault will only remove the first instance and the second instance of vault address will still remain active

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Observe the `addVault` function

```solidity
function addVault(address vault_) external override permissioned {
        activeVaults.push(vault_);
        ++activeVaultCount;

        emit VaultAdded(vault_);
    }
```

2. Lets say `addVault` is called twice for Vault A, since there is no duplicate check so activeVaults will have {A,A}
3. Vault A is not needed anymore and removed via `removeVault`

```solidity
function removeVault(address vault_) external override permissioned {
        // Find index of vault in array
        for (uint256 i; i < activeVaultCount; ) {
            if (activeVaults[i] == vault_) {
                // Delete vault from array by swapping with last element and popping
                activeVaults[i] = activeVaults[activeVaults.length - 1];
                activeVaults.pop();
                --activeVaultCount;
                break;
            }

            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }

        emit VaultRemoved(vault_);
    }
```

4. As we can see after deleting first instance of A vault, loop will break and the duplicate entry of vault A will not get deleted

## Impact
A vault which is supposed to be deleted will still exist
