# addVault() and removeVault() fail to detect duplicate vaults

## Summary
``addVault()`` and ``removeVault()`` fail to detect duplicate vaults. As a result, 

1) the same vault might be registered multiple times in  ``OlympusLiquidityRegistry``.

2) ``removeVault`` also fails to remove all the duplicates - it will only remove the first occurrence.

3) ``activeVaultCount`` will count wrongly since duplicates will be counted multiple times. 

## Vulnerability Detail

First, ``addVault()`` will add a vault without checking whether it is already registered or not. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/modules/LQREG/OlympusLiquidityRegistry.sol#L35-L40](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/modules/LQREG/OlympusLiquidityRegistry.sol#L35-L40)

As a result, the same vault can be added multiple times. 

Second, the ``removeVault()`` only removes the first occurrence of a vault in the list, therefore, if there are duplicates introduced by ``addVault()``, other duplicates will not be removed. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/modules/LQREG/OlympusLiquidityRegistry.sol#L43-L61](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/modules/LQREG/OlympusLiquidityRegistry.sol#L43-L61)

Third, because of the existence of duplicates, the ``activeVaultCount`` will give the wrong number since duplicates will be counted multiple times. 


## Impact
Duplicates of vaults might appear in the registry, and removal is incomplete since duplicates will not be removed, and ``activeVaultCount``  might be wrong due to duplicates.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Introduce an index for each vault so that duplicates will be detected and never allowed. 
```diff
+ mapping (address => uint256) vaultIndex;

 function addVault(address vault_) external override permissioned {
+     if(activeVaults[vaultIndex[vault_]] == vault_) vaultAlreadyRegistered(vault_);

        activeVaults.push(vault_);

+     vaultIndex[vault_] = activeVaultCount;

        ++activeVaultCount;


        emit VaultAdded(vault_);
    }

function removeVault(address vault_) external override permissioned {
+     uint256 index = vaultIndex[vault_];
+     if(activeVaults[index] != vault_) vaultNotRegistered(vault_);

+        address lastVault = activeVault[activeVaultCount-1];

+          activeVault[index] = lastVault;
+          activeVault.pop();
+          vaultIndex[lastVault] = index;
+          delete vaultIndex[vault_];

-        // Find index of vault in array
-        for (uint256 i; i < activeVaultCount; ) {
-            if (activeVaults[i] == vault_) {
-                // Delete vault from array by swapping with last element and popping
-                activeVaults[i] = activeVaults[activeVaults.length - 1];
-                activeVaults.pop();
-                --activeVaultCount;
-                break;
-            }

-            unchecked {
-                ++i;
-            }
-        }

-        emit VaultRemoved(vault_);
     }

```
