# The same Vault can be added multiple times in AddVault

## Summary
The Addvault in the OlympusLiquidityRegistry.sol contract adds a Vault to the array ActiveVaults. However, the same vault can be re-added multiple times in the Addvault function in the Registry as there is no check on whether the vault has been entered before. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The addvault function here has no checks on whether a vault has been added before

And the activate function in the vault contract does not check if a vault has been added before

## Impact
This can lead to incorrect information in the Registry Contract which according to the docs,  is supposed to be a single source of information for reporting shown here.

Net emissions and OHM deployed may be incorrect and can impact protocol functionality as the same Vault can be added multiple times

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add checks to make sure that a Vault has not been added already. e.g. Add a require statement in the Activate function checking if a Vault already exists in the Active Vaults array
