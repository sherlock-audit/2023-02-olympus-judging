# Duplicate Vault

## Summary
The `addVault` function fails to verify the vault already exists, thus allowing the addition on the same vault twice.

## Vulnerability Detail
- A bug was found in the [addVault](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/modules/LQREG/OlympusLiquidityRegistry.sol#L35).
- The bug is that the `addVault` function does not check if the vault already exists in the `activeVaults` array before adding it.

## Impact
- The `removeVault` function would act unexpectedly if a vault was added twice. It would only remove one instance of the vault and leave the other one in the array.
- This is problematic because it could cause duplicate entries and waste gas.


## Code Snippet
The buggy function is:

```solidity
function addVault(address vault_) external override permissioned {
        activeVaults.push(vault_);
        ++activeVaultCount;

        emit VaultAdded(vault_);
    }
```


## Tool used
Manual Review


## Recommendation
-   One possible way to fix the bug is to add a check for existence in the `addVault` function and revert if the vault is already in the array.
-   Alternatively, use a mapping instead of an array to store active vaults and avoid duplicates.
