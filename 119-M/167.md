# Possible Integer overflow/ underflow in withdraw function

## Summary
Possible Integer overflow/ underflow in `withdraw` function in `SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol`

## Vulnerability Detail
Without a check in place, the calculation `totalLP -= lpAmount_` could potentially lead to an interger underflow if lpAmount > totalLP. 

While in theory lpAmount > totalLP should not be possible (i.e. indicates that LP bookkeeping is incorrect), there could be cases where an external event (e.g. flash loan) temporarily manipulates the balance of LP tokens in the contract, causing the contract to think it has more LP tokens than it actually has. 

## Impact
It could lead to unexpected behavior in a smart contract / potentially be exploited by attackers to steal funds or disrupt the contract's functioning.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Incude a check to ensure that lpAmount is not greater that totalLP / check that `totalLP -= lpAmount_` does not result in a negative number.
