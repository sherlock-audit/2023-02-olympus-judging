# `totalAccumulatedRewards` has an incorrect decimals

## Summary
`totalAccumulatedRewards` has 36 decimals instead of 18

## Vulnerability Detail
Both `lpPositions[user_]` and `accumulatedRewardsPerShare` have 18 decimals, meaning the product will have 36 decimals.

totalAccumulatedRewards will have 36 decimals, leading the return value of `internalRewardsForToken` to also have 36 decimals instead of 18

## Impact
Incorrect reward amount computed, users receive more than expected, or the function reverts, leading to user unable to claim what they should get.
