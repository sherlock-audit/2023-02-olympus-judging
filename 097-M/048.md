# WstethLiquidityVault contract will be needed to redeploy as getUserWstethShare function is internal instead of external

## Summary
WstethLiquidityVault contract will be needed to redeploy as getUserWstethShare function is internal instead of external
## Vulnerability Detail
WstethLiquidityVault.getUserWstethShare is designed to bu used by frontend to show user their wsteth balance.
The problem is that by mistake it is marked as [internal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/WstethLiquidityVault.sol#L326), while it should be external.

Because of that after deploying, developers will notice that fact and will need to redeploy new contract with external function.
This creates inconvenience and additional gas costs.
