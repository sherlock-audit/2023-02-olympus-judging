# Adding external reward token could brick receiving rewards

## Summary

Without a sanity check for a new external reward token, it can be a pair token or duplicated external reward token.

## Vulnerability Detail

When adding a new external reward token its lacks validation, should check either if the address is duplicated or a pair token. Adding a duplicated address can cause damage the protocol by sending an incorrect amount of reward to users.

## Impact

When adding a duplicated token the reward amount received by the user can be counted incorrectly and by setting it to pair the user will receive pair tokens as rewards which is not possible.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L708-L717

```solidity
function addExternalRewardToken(address token_) external onlyRole("liquidityvault_admin") {
  ExternalRewardToken memory newRewardToken = ExternalRewardToken({
    token: token_,
    decimalsAdjustment: 10**ERC20(token_).decimals(),
    accumulatedRewardsPerShare: 0,
    lastBalance: 0
  });

  externalRewardTokens.push(newRewardToken);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Is recommended to add checks to ensure the token:

1. Is not duplicated
2. Is not a pair token
