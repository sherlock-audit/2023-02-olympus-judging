# `pairTokenDecimals` VARIABLE IS USED AS BOTH `storage` variable and `memory` VARIABLE

## Summary

`pairTokenDecimals` variables is used both as a storage variable and memory variable inside the `SingleSidedLiquidityVault` contract. The variable is firstly declared as a state variable in the contract and later declared as memory variable inside the `_isPoolSafe()` function.

## Vulnerability Detail

Since the same variable name `pairTokenDecimals` is defined as both storage and memory it can be confusing to both developers and auditors. And local memory variable can be over shadowed by the storage variable which can lead to unexpected behaviour in the protocol calculations.

## Impact

Since the same variable name `pairTokenDecimals` is defined as both storage and memory it can be confusing to both developers and auditors. And local memory variable can be over shadowed by the storage variable which can lead to unexpected behaviour in the protocol calculations.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    // Token Decimals
    uint256 public pairTokenDecimals;
```

```solidity
    function _isPoolSafe() internal view returns (bool) {
        uint256 pairTokenDecimals = pairToken.decimals();
```

## Tool used

VS Code and Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to use two different variable names instead of `pairTokenDecimals`, to differentiate between the state variable of the contract and local variable used inside the `_isPoolSafe()` function.
