# claiming external rewards via `externalRewardsForToken` fails in some cases even when users are entitled to external rewards

## Summary

Claiming external rewards via `externalRewardsForToken` (in `SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol`) fails in some cases even when users are entitled to external rewards. The code path starts from `claimRewards` and is possible due to a misplaced calculation.

## Vulnerability Detail

`claimRewards` calls `_claimExternalRewards` to get valid external rewards for user. This function in turn, calls `externalRewardsForToken` to get the available amount to share.

Here extermal rewards are calculate by adding 2 sources:
1) accumulated rewards generated from having shares of the pools
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L379-L383
    - taking the coressponding LP generated rewards and removing owed user debts `userRewardDebts[user_][rewardToken.token]`
2) rewards that have been accumulated but not claimed (`cachedUserRewards`)
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L385


The issue lies with `totalAccumulatedRewards` as in the way it's calculated causes, in some cases, a negative result, and since it is `uint256` results in an revert.

`totalAccumulatedRewards` is calculate as the gains from the users' LP positions (which only increase when the user deposits more collateral) minus the considered user reward debt (which is increasable in other areas of the code). This way of calculating it allows for negative values to possibly appear.

## Impact

Users are left with external rewards they are entitled to but cannot access without needing to further deposit liquidity into the pool.

## Code Snippet

POC that shows a normal user use case and revert follows (for `WstethLiquidityVaultMock.t`).

```Solidity
    function testCorrectness_externalRewardsRevertsOnSubtraction(address user_) public {
        
        vm.assume(user_ != address(0) && user_ != alice && user_ != address(liquidityVault));

        // Setup
        _withdrawTimeSetUp();

        // Add second depositor
        vm.startPrank(user_);
        wsteth.mint(user_, 1e18);
        wsteth.approve(address(liquidityVault), 1e18);
        liquidityVault.deposit(1e18, 1e18);
        vm.stopPrank();
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 10); // Increase time by 10 seconds

        // Trigger external rewards accumulation
        vm.prank(alice);
        liquidityVault.withdraw(1e18, minTokenAmounts_, false);

        // Alice's rewards should be 1.5 external tokens and her current balance 0
        assertEq(liquidityVault.externalRewardsForToken(0, alice), 15e17);
        assertEq(externalReward.balanceOf(alice), 0);

        // normal user activity
        vm.prank(alice);
        liquidityVault.claimRewards();
        
        // simply checking the externalRewardsForToken function reverts 
        vm.expectRevert();
        liquidityVault.externalRewardsForToken(0, alice);    
        
        // user waits and want so claim again
        vm.expectRevert();
        vm.prank(alice);
        liquidityVault.claimRewards();
    }
```

## Recommendation

Move the problematic operations in the final calculation of the return statement. Example implementation:

```Solidity
         ExternalRewardToken memory rewardToken = externalRewardTokens[id_];
 
         // This correctly uses 1e18 because the LP tokens of all major DEXs have 18 decimals
-        uint256 totalAccumulatedRewards = (lpPositions[user_] *
-            rewardToken.accumulatedRewardsPerShare) - userRewardDebts[user_][rewardToken.token];
-
-        return (cachedUserRewards[user_][rewardToken.token] + totalAccumulatedRewards) / 1e18;
+        return (cachedUserRewards[user_][rewardToken.token] + (lpPositions[user_] *
+            rewardToken.accumulatedRewardsPerShare) - userRewardDebts[user_][rewardToken.token]) / 1e18;
     }

```
or declare `totalAccumulatedRewards` as `int256` instead of `uint256`.
