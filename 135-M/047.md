# WstethLiquidityVault.rescueFundsFromAura doesn't claim rewards

## Summary
WstethLiquidityVault.rescueFundsFromAura doesn't claim rewards
## Vulnerability Detail
`WstethLiquidityVault.rescueFundsFromAura` function is designed to withdraw all funds from Aura. This is needed in order when smth happened to contract.
Once funds are withdrawn, then `SingleSidedLiquidityVault.rescueToken` can be used in order to withdraw any token from contract.

The problem is that `WstethLiquidityVault.rescueFundsFromAura` [doesn't claim rewards](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/WstethLiquidityVault.sol#L361) as it provides `false` to withdrawAndUnwrap function.

Because of that contract losses some part of rewards from Aura.
## Impact
Contract losses some part of rewards from Aura, which can be claimed instead and withdrawn from contract.
