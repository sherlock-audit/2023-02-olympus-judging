# Incorect math for `ohmRemoved`

## Summary

Incorect math for `ohmRemoved` in `withdraw()` function in `SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol`.

## Vulnerability Detail

`ohmRemoved` calculated this way in `withdraw()` function:

```Solidity
{
	(uint256 ohmReceived, uint256 pairTokenReceived) = _withdraw(lpAmount_, minTokenAmounts_);

	ohmMinted -= ohmReceived > ohmMinted ? ohmMinted : ohmReceived;
	ohmRemoved += ohmReceived > ohmMinted ? ohmReceived - ohmMinted : 0;
}
```

By design `ohmRemoved` should not be increased (unless `ohmReceived` > `ohmMinted` and then it should be increased by `ohmReceived` - `ohmMinted`). 

Let's look at example when `ohmReceived > ohmMinted` => `ohmMinted -= ohmMinted` => `ohmMinted = 0`. 

Then `ohmRemoved += ohmReceived > ohmMinted ? ohmReceived - ohmMinted : 0` => `ohmRemoved += ohmReceived > 0 ? ohmReceived - 0 : 0` => `ohmRemoved += ohmReceived`
## Impact

The pool will be able to accept more funds than expected. 

```Solidity
    function _canDeposit(uint256 amount_) internal view virtual returns (bool) {
        if (amount_ + ohmMinted > LIMIT + ohmRemoved) revert LiquidityVault_LimitViolation();
        return true;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Save the previous value and calculate using it. It will also save some gas.

```Solidity
{
	(uint256 ohmReceived, uint256 pairTokenReceived) = _withdraw(lpAmount_, minTokenAmounts_);
	
	uint256 oldOhmMinted = ohmMinted;
	ohmMinted -= ohmReceived > oldOhmMinted ? oldOhmMinted : ohmReceived;
	ohmRemoved += ohmReceived > oldOhmMinted ? ohmReceived - oldOhmMinted : 0;
}
```
