# ohmRemoved is calculated incorrectly inside SingleSidedLiquidityVault.withdraw function

## Summary
ohmRemoved is calculated incorrectly inside SingleSidedLiquidityVault.withdraw function
## Vulnerability Detail
`ohmRemoved` variable is created to keep track of ohm tokens removed from circulation. The more such tokens, the [more tokens users can deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L407).

This is how it's updated inside withdraw function.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L276-L277
```solidity
        ohmMinted -= ohmReceived > ohmMinted ? ohmMinted : ohmReceived;
        ohmRemoved += ohmReceived > ohmMinted ? ohmReceived - ohmMinted : 0;
```

The problem here is that `ohmMinted` is not cached here, before it's updated.
This is how it should work.
Suppose `ohmMinted == 100` and `ohmRemoved == 0`. Only one user deposited(for simplicity). Now this user withdraws all his vault tokens and he receives 120 ohm, instead of 100, as price of ohm has decreased.
So now `ohmMinted` should be 0 and `ohmRemoved` should be 20, but because of wrong calculation `ohmRemoved` will be 120, as `ohmMinted` became 0 already. 

As you can see in this example, deposit limit has increased by 120 ohm instead of 20. During the time that calculation error can increase limit strongly.
## Impact
Deposit limit is increased more than needed.

## Recommendation
Do calculations like this.
```solidity
uint256 ohmMintedCopy = ohmMinted;
ohmMinted -= ohmReceived > ohmMinted ? ohmMinted : ohmReceived;
ohmRemoved += ohmReceived > ohmMintedCopy ? ohmReceived - ohmMintedCopy : 0;
```
