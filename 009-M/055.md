# Incorrect calculation of ohmRemoved

## Summary

The `ohmRemoved` calculation is incorrect because it updates the ohmMinted variable before use.

## Vulnerability Detail

When `withdraw` some amount of LP Tokens, the `ohmRemoved` variable is calculated using the difference of `ohmReceived` and `ohmMinted`. 

Each withdrawal that ohmReceived is greater than ohmMinted adds an incorrect value to ohmRemoved, consider the example:

1. ohmMinted = 1000, ohmReceived = 1500
2. In line 276 ohmMinted would be calculated as
    
    `ohmMinted -= 1000` 
    
3. After the update ohmMinted it would be used again in line 277:
    
    `ohmRemoved += ohmReceived > ohmMinted ? ohmReceived - ohmMinted : 0`
    
    `ohmRemoved += 1500 > 0 ? 1500 - 0 : 0`
    
    `ohmRemoved += 1500`
    
4. The value calculated for ohmRemoved should be `1500-1000 = 500` but it receive the value of `1500`

## Impact

The incorrect calculation of ohmRemoved rewards affects the functions: `getMaxDeposit`, `getOhmEmissions`, `_canDeposit` . The problems are incorrect calculation of deposit value while getting max deposit and ohm emissions or DoSing the deposits in _canDeposit function

## Code Snippet

```solidity
ohmMinted -= ohmReceived > ohmMinted ? ohmMinted : ohmReceived;
ohmRemoved += ohmReceived > ohmMinted ? ohmReceived - ohmMinted : 0;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Is recommended to cache ohmMinted before calculating ohmRemoved

```diff
- ohmMinted -= ohmReceived > ohmMinted ? ohmMinted : ohmReceived;
- ohmRemoved += ohmReceived > ohmMinted ? ohmReceived - ohmMinted : 0;
+ uint256 cachedOhmMinted = ohmMinted;
+ ohmMinted -= ohmReceived > cachedOhmMinted ? cachedOhmMinted : ohmReceived;
+ ohmRemoved += ohmReceived > cachedOhmMinted ? cachedOhmMinted - ohmMinted : 0;

```
