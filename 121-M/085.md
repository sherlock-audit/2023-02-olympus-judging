# ActiveVaultCount Variable Can Overflow and Underflow.

## Summary
In the `addVault` and `removeVault` functions, the `activeVaultCount` variable is incremented and decremented in these functions respectively, but there is no check to ensure that the variable does not overflow or underflow. 

## Vulnerability Detail

and

`activeVaultCount` variable is a uint256 type and is incremented in the `addVault` function and decremented in the `removeVault` function, when the `addVault` function is called, the `activeVaultCount` variable is incremented by 1, but there is no check to ensure that the value does not overflow the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256 variable. 
Similarly, in the `removeVault` function, the `activeVaultCount` variable is decremented by 1, but there is no check to ensure that the value does not underflow the minimum value that can be stored in a uint256 variable.

If the `activeVaultCount` variable overflows or underflows, it can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially create security vulnerabilities, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability to manipulate the state of the contract, which could result in the loss of user funds or other undesired effects.

## Impact
If an attacker successfully exploits this vulnerability, they could cause the `activeVaultCount` variable to overflow or underflow, which could result in unexpected behavior or even a contract crash.

## Recommendation
Add a check to ensure that the `activeVaultCount` variable does not overflow or underflow.
