# for loop might run infinitely

## Summary
for loop if-statement might not stop running until it runs out of gas
## Vulnerability Detail
On lines [Lines 198-206](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/WstethLiquidityVault.sol#L198-L206) in WstethLiquidityVault.sol the function `_accumulateExternalRewards()`'s for loop might run infinitely until it runs out of gas. This is because if the if-statement inside of the for loop were to be true it would continuously  loop since the [continue statement](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/WstethLiquidityVault.sol#L205) would cut off the variable `i` from incrementing on [line 212](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/WstethLiquidityVault.sol#L212) which would make the for loop condition true continuously
## Impact
would cause a denial of service to contracts using this function

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make sure the variable `i` can increment or some other way that it will not make the for loop condition continuously be true like adding a revert to the for loop. One way of fixing it might be like so:
```solidity
        for (uint256 i; i < numExternalRewards; ) {
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
            ExternalRewardToken storage rewardToken = externalRewardTokens[i];
            uint256 newBalance = ERC20(rewardToken.token).balanceOf(address(this));


            // This shouldn't happen but adding a sanity check in case
            if (newBalance < rewardToken.lastBalance) {
                emit LiquidityVault_ExternalAccumulationError(rewardToken.token);
                continue;
            }


            rewards[i] = newBalance - rewardToken.lastBalance;
            rewardToken.lastBalance = newBalance;
        }
```
