# Decimal issue with `` userRewardDebts`` might lead to over-claim/under-claim of rewards

## Summary
Decimal issue with ``userRewardDebts`` might lead to over-claim/under-claim of rewards

## Vulnerability Detail
We analyze the decimal issue with ``userRewardDebts`` below: 

1) we notice that the calculation of ``accumulatedRewardsPerShare`` is scaled by 1e18, for both internal and external rewards. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L488-L502](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L488-L502)

2) Then, ``internalRewardsForToken()`` calculates the rewards for a user for an internal reward token. Note that L368-371 show that ``userRewardDebts`` must be scaled up by 1e18 as well since L371 will scale it down by 1e18 to get the final reward of the user. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L354-L372](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L354-L372)

3) However, when ``_claimInternalRewards()`` is called, while L625 calls the function ``internalRewardsForToken()``, which scales down the final sum by 1e18 to get ``reward``, here at L628, it adds ``reward`` to  ``userRewardDebts`` without scaling it up first. This means, when ``internalRewardsForToken()`` is called again, the ``userRewardDebts`` part (which is not scaled up by 1e18) will be scaled down by 1e18, which makes the addition of ``reward`` of L628 ignorable. This is a problem, the two terms at L628 have a 1e18 scale difference.  One need to scale ``reward`` by 1e18 FIRST before adding it to ``userRewardDebts``.

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L623-L634](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L623-L634)

4) Similar analysis needs to be done for ``cachedUserRewards`` as well to make sure it has the right decimal (scale-up).

## Impact
The scale of ``userRewardDebts`` is a problem. A value added to it needs to be scaled up by 1e18 first. Because of this bug, some users will claim more rewards and others will have no rewards to claim later.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We will scale up a value by 1e18 each time when we add the value to ``userRewardDebts``.  
```diff
function _claimInternalRewards(uint256 id_) internal {
        address rewardToken = internalRewardTokens[id_].token;
        uint256 reward = internalRewardsForToken(id_, msg.sender);
        uint256 fee = (reward * FEE) / PRECISION;

-        userRewardDebts[msg.sender][rewardToken] += reward;
+        userRewardDebts[msg.sender][rewardToken] += reward*1e18;
  
        accumulatedFees[rewardToken] += fee;

        if (reward > 0) ERC20(rewardToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, reward - fee);

        emit RewardsClaimed(msg.sender, rewardToken, reward - fee);
    }
```
