# Decimal error in reward debt handling

## Summary
`userRewardDebts` is the product of `lpTokenAmount` and `accumulatedRewardsPerShare` and is a 36 decimal quantity. The protocol updates it with a wrong value and wrong decimals 2 places.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function `internalRewardsForToken` calculates the rewards owed to the user. 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L354-L372
`totalAccumulatedRewards` is a 36 decimal quantity, and the return value of this function is thus an 18 decimal quantity, as can be seen from the return statement. 

The return value however is used to update the `userRewardDebts` value, which is supposed to be 36 decimals
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L625-L628
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L638-L641
Since an 18 decimals number is used to update a 36 decimal number wrongly, this leads to larger and larger errors as time goes on, and `userRewardDebts` get more significant. `userRewardDebts` should instead be updated by the product of `reward` and the `accumulatedRewardPerShare` of the relevant token.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update the calculation as 
```solidity
userRewardDebts[msg.sender][rewardToken.token] += reward * rewardToken.accumulatedRewardsPerShare
```
