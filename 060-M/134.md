# User might no be able to withdraw entire deposit amount

## Summary
Approval is not reset in between transactions.

## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens like USDT do not allow approving an amount `M > 0` when an existing amount `N > 0` is already approved.

This could lead to a user only being able to deposit a `pairToken` once and possibly not being able to withdraw all of it if withdrawal is not done in a single transaction.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Set approval to zero after transfer to ensure next transaction's approval is accepted.
