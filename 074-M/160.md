# ```_accumulateExternalRewards``` might revert due to an infinite loop

## Summary

An edge case in the ```WstethLiquidityVault``` contract's ```_accumulateExternalRewards``` function could cause an infinite loop which might lead to the transaction reverting.

## Vulnerability Detail

The ```_accumulateExternalRewards``` function in ```WstethLiquidityVault.sol``` checks if an external reward token's balance has decreased since lastBalance was updated. If this is the case, the for loop will continue without incrementing the loop variable ```i```.  The same reward token will be checked continuously until the new balance is larger than or equal to the last balance of the reward token, or until the transaction runs out of gas and reverts. 

To recover from this, reward tokens must be sent directly to the vault so that the balance is more than the last balance or the admin must remove the reward token.

## Impact

Since ```_accumulateExternalRewards``` is used in the ```claimRewards```, ```_depositUpdateRewardState``` and ```_withdrawUpdateRewardState``` functions, it reverting might lead to important functionality not working. Users might be unable to claim, deposit or withdraw when they want to.

## Code Snippet

Below is a snippet from the ```_accumulateExternalRewards``` function that shows the loop will continue before incrementing the loop variable ```i```.

[WstethLiquidityVault.sol:_accumulateExternalRewards#L202-L213](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/WstethLiquidityVault.sol#L202-L213):
```solidity
            // This shouldn't happen but adding a sanity check in case
            if (newBalance < rewardToken.lastBalance) {
                emit LiquidityVault_ExternalAccumulationError(rewardToken.token);
                continue;
            }

            rewards[i] = newBalance - rewardToken.lastBalance;
            rewardToken.lastBalance = newBalance;

            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
```

In the unlikely case that the new balance is less than the old balance, functions such as [```claimRewards```](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L292), [```_depositUpdateRewardState```](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L512) and [```_withdrawUpdateRewardState```](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L572) might not be callable.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider incrementing the loop variable ```i``` in the case that the vault's new reward token balance is less than its last balance.
