# claiming rewards can be started before startTimestamp_

## Summary
when first depositor made first deposit the updateInternalRewardState function sets lastRewardTime to block.timestamp without checking lastRewardTime has arrived 
## Vulnerability Details 
if admin set startTimestamp_ after block.timestamp the startTimestamp_ stores as lastRewardTime and when first depositor made first deposit, lastRewardTime will change to block.timestamp which means claiming rewards starts at the time and before startTimestamp_.
## Impact
token distributes the rewards before startTimestamp_ .
