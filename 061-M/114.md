# Activate function may be mistakenly called twice

## Summary

The activate() function on SSLV vaults does not have any guards against calling it while the vault is already active. This would add it twice to the liquidity registry and cause incorrect Ohm accounting.

## Vulnerability Detail

The activate and deactivate functions do not have guards that ensure they are only called in the correct state. This may result in activate() being called multiple times, leading to multiple registrations of the same vault in the liquidity registry, and incorrect Ohm accounting.

## Impact

Ohm accounting is incorrect in the core Olympus contracts.

## Recommendation

Add guards in the activate and deactivate functions such that they revert if `isVaultActive` is true or false, respectively.
