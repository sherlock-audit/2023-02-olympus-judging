# `THRESHOLD` can be set to values that would endanger protocol by allowing manipulated oracle prices

## Summary

`THRESHOLD` (from `SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol`), which is used to calculate a tolerance limit for oracle price deviation, can be set to values that would endanger the protocol by allowing manipulated oracle prices. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Both `withdraw` and `deposit` use the `_isPoolSafe()` function to validate if should continue operations.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L261

`_isPoolSafe` checks if pool price deviates, in an accepted margin, from the oracle price.
The accepted bounds are calculated as such:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L417-L418

And the `THRESHOLD` can be set here, but it must not be more then `PRECISION` (1000) 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L793-L796

The issue is that `_isPoolSafe` in conjunction with the `THRESHOLD` limitations when set by `setThreshold` allows for, at worst case, an accepted price interval from 0 to 200% of `oraclePrice`

__There is no valid case to allow for such a large variation range__

## Impact

A mistakenly set `THRESHOLD` value too high would allow price manipulation of oracles/pools to degrade the protocol

## Code Snippet

In order to do this test we needed to modify the access level of `_isPoolSafe` from *internal* to **public**.

We can see in the next POC (which can be added to `WstethLiquidityVaultMock.t`) that setting the threshold to it's maximum accepted value (`PRECISION`) would result in the protocol accepting price variactions from `[0, 2*oraclePrice]`

```Solidity
    function test_maxThresholdVariation() public {
        

        uint256 pairTokenDecimals = liquidityVault.pairToken().decimals();
        uint256 oraclePrice = liquidityVault._valueCollateral(10**pairTokenDecimals); // 1 pair token in OHM

        // Set threshold to dangerous level
        liquidityVault.setThreshold(liquidityVault.PRECISION());

        // validate that pool logic considers it safe        
        assertTrue(liquidityVault._isPoolSafe());

        // lowerBound and upperBound from isPoolSafe are not exported, so we calculate them as as in the function, in place
        uint256 lowerBound = (oraclePrice * (liquidityVault.PRECISION() - liquidityVault.THRESHOLD())) / liquidityVault.PRECISION();
        uint256 upperBound = (oraclePrice * (liquidityVault.PRECISION() + liquidityVault.THRESHOLD())) / liquidityVault.PRECISION();

        // validate the limits
        assertEq(lowerBound, 0);
        assertEq(upperBound, oraclePrice*2);

    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Create a separate `THRESHOLD_LIMIT` and set it to a tolerated, precautions value, such as 200.
By giving it 200, you can, at max, accept price variations of [80% - 120%] of oracle price, which is still quite high. Do not reuse the `PRECISION` limit just because it's more accessible.

This `THRESHOLD_LIMIT` to be verified when setting the `THRESHOLD`. Example implementation:

```Solidity
     // Configuration values
     uint256 public LIMIT;
     uint256 public THRESHOLD;
+    uint256 public constant THRESHOLD_LIMIT = 200;
     uint256 public FEE;
     uint256 public constant PRECISION = 1000;
     bool public isVaultActive;

     // ....

     /// @dev                       This function can only be accessed by the liquidityvault_admin role
     function setThreshold(uint256 threshold_) external onlyRole("liquidityvault_admin") {
-        if (threshold_ > PRECISION) revert LiquidityVault_InvalidParams();
+        if (threshold_ > THRESHOLD_LIMIT) revert LiquidityVault_InvalidParams();
         THRESHOLD = threshold_;
     }
 
```
