# `deposit()` always returns zero

## Summary
[`SingleSidedLiquidityVault.deposit()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L187) always returns the amount of minted LP tokens as zero. 

## Vulnerability Detail
`deposit()` is supposed to return the amount of LP tokens received through the named return parameter [`lpAmountOut`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L191). However, `lpAmountOut` is not set in the method body, resulting in the method always returning zero.

## Impact
The invalid return value can break external contracts (third-party as well as Olympus) utilizing Olympus' `SingleSidedLiquidityVault` to, for example, generate yield by depositing tokens into the vault and using the `deposit()` return value to track the amount of LP tokens they received, potentially leading to loss of funds on external contracts.

## Code Snippet
PoC omitted in this case due to the bug being clearly visible when looking at the method body. 

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Set `lpAmountOut = lpReceived` before `return`ing or do not declare `lpReceived` at all and instead use `lpAmountOut` to return the correct amount of LP tokens received.
