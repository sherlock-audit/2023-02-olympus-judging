# Reentrancy in WstethLiquidityVault.

## Summary
`WstethLiquidityVault` contract has a reentrancy vulnerability in its `_deposit` function that could lead to unexpected behavior or even loss of funds. An attacker can also exploit this vulnerability to repeatedly call the `_deposit` function before the previous function call has been completed, to drain the liquidity pool.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_deposit` function in the `WstethLiquidityVault` contract calls several external contracts, including the Balancer vault and the Aura booster, these external contracts could have vulnerabilities that enable reentrancy attacks, which would allow an attacker to repeatedly call the `_deposit` function before the previous function call has been completed, leading to unexpected behavior and or loss of funds.

## Impact
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to repeatedly call the `_deposit` function before the previous function call has been completed, which could lead to unexpected behavior or loss of funds. For example, an attacker could deposit the same funds multiple times, receive a larger amount of BPT, and potentially drain the liquidity pool.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In the `_deposit` function, one possible implementation I can recommend is to use the `nonReentrant` modifier from the OpenZeppelin `ReentrancyGuard` contract, another possible implementation is to use a `boolean` flag to track whether the `_deposit` function is currently executing and revert if it is called again before the previous function call has completed.
