# If internal reward tokens run out, then withdrawals are blocked

## Summary

If internal reward tokens run out, then withdrawals are blocked because withdraw also claims rewards and doesn’t check if there actually are enough rewards available

## Vulnerability Detail

Owner needs to transfer internal reward tokens to the protocol. Tokens are accounted for users on a per-block basis. If the tokens run out, then there is no check for the balance on the contract, and the tx reverts. Awards are also claimed in `withdraw` function, which means withdrawals will be blocked.

## Impact

User cannot withdraw funds due to protocol not having enough tokens to pay rewards.

## Code Snippet

Here is a PoC test that fails because project tries to transfer tokens that aren’t available.

```solidity
function testCanWithdrawIfRewardsFinished() public {        
    vm.prank(guardian);
    liquidityVault.addInternalRewardToken(address(ohm), 1e9, block.timestamp); // 1 OHM token per second
		// Send 10 OHM tokens to the Vault
    deal(address(ohm), address(liquidityVault), 10e9);
    
    vm.prank(alice);
    liquidityVault.deposit(WSTETH_AMOUNT, 0);
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 11); // Increase time 11 seconds so that there aren't enough tokens to pay as rewards

    vm.prank(alice);
    liquidityVault.withdraw(liquidityVault.lpPositions(alice), minTokenAmounts_, false);
}
```

```solidity
│   ├─ [1191] ohm::transfer(alice: [0x5dad7600C5D89fE3824fFa99ec1c3eB8BF3b0501], 10999999977)
│   │   └─ ← "ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance"
```

## Tool used

Manual Review, Foundry

## Recommendation

Don’t revert if there aren’t enough internal reward tokens available. Optionally add a boolean that user can switch to withdraw without reward claiming.
