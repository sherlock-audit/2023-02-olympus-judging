# Unbounded loops in claimRewards could lead to a loss in rewards

## Summary
DOS is possible when the admin(liquidityvault_admin) adds more internal and external reward tokens, which could cause excessive gas consumed and even transactions reverted when users try to claim their rewards and the combined array is too large..

## Vulnerability Detail
Overtime the internal and external reward tokens could organically grow into a large array, that could cause a DOS when a user tries to claim their rewards.

## Impact
Users could lose all their rewards. Based on one my other report, if the admin try to rectify the problem by removing some reward tokens, the users will lose the rewards of those tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
One solution could to claim per token and not the entire arrays or be able to claim a range of tokens.
