# Missing Reset of newAdmin Variable in RolesAdmin Contract.

## Summary
`RolesAdmin` contract could allow an attacker to exploit the contract by pushing a new admin address and then calling `pullNewAdmin` multiple times to repeatedly take control of the contract. Specifically, the pullNewAdmin function does not reset the newAdmin variable to `address(0)` after successfully transferring admin privileges to the new address.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `RolesAdmin` policy, specifically in the `pullNewAdmin()` function, the issue is that the `newAdmin` variable is not reset to `address(0)` after successfully transferring admin privileges to the new address, and this means that if an attacker were to push a new admin address and then call `pullNewAdmin()` multiple times, they could repeatedly take control of the contract.

Let's break down to understand this vulnerability in more detail. 
The `RolesAdmin` contract is used to grant and revoke roles in the "ROLES" module, the admin variable holds the address of the current admin, and the `newAdmin` variable holds the proposed new admin's address.

The `pushNewAdmin()` function is used to propose a new admin address. This function can only be called by the current admin, and it sets the `newAdmin` variable to the new admin's address.

The pullNewAdmin() function is used to transfer admin privileges to the proposed new admin. This function can only be called by the proposed new admin, and it sets the admin variable to the new admin's address and resets the `newAdmin` variable to `address(0)`.

However, the vulnerability lies in the fact that the `newAdmin` variable is not reset to `address(0)` after successfully transferring admin privileges to the new address. 
This means that if an attacker were to call `pushNewAdmin()` and propose a new admin address, and then call `pullNewAdmin()` to transfer admin privileges to that address, they could still call `pushNewAdmin()` again and propose a new admin address, they could then repeat this process as many times as they want, effectively taking control of the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `newAdmin` variable should be reset to `address(0)` after successfully transferring admin privileges to the new address. This can be done by adding the line `newAdmin = address(0);` after `admin = newAdmin;` in the `pullNewAdmin()` function.
