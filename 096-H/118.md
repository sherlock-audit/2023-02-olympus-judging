# [H] - Approval of pool tokens for the Balancer vault is not required before exiting the pool.

## Summary
Before exiting the pool in `_withdraw` function, pool.approve is called which gives access of some tokens to the balancer vault.
This is actually not needed as exiting the pool does not require any transfers and it can be done without approving.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `_withdraw()` function of `WstethLiquidityVault.sol`, the below is coded:-
```solidity
				// Exit Balancer pool
        pool.approve(address(vault), lpAmount_);
        vault.exitPool(pool.getPoolId(), address(this), payable(address(this)), exitPoolRequest);
```
However, the approve function is not needed.
Here's a small test that shows that the approval amount is unused after the `withdraw` transaction
```solidity
// Please add the below in "IBalancer.sol" to imitate the below test
function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256);

function testCorrectness__withdrawDoesntFail_noTimeChange() public {
        _withdrawSetUp();

        // Get alice lp position
        uint256 aliceLpPosition = liquidityVault.lpPositions(alice);

        console2.log("Allowance Before withdraw is ==>", liquidityPool.allowance(address(liquidityVault), address(vault)));
        
        // Withdraw and claim
        vm.prank(alice);
        liquidityVault.withdraw(aliceLpPosition, minTokenAmounts_, true);

        console2.log("Allowance After withdraw is ==>", liquidityPool.allowance(address(liquidityVault), address(vault)));
    }
```
The output will be as shown below
```solidity
[PASS] testCorrectness__withdrawDoesntFail_noTimeChange() (gas: 995945)
Logs:
  Allowance Before withdraw is ==> 0
  Allowance After withdraw is ==> 26440243286851883495
```

## Impact
This can cause some serious problems if the external contract has some function that can make use of this approved tokens.
