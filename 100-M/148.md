# Withdraw transactions would revert if ohmReceived > ohmMinted.

## Summary

The withdraw transaction might get reverted if ohmReceived from the `_withdraw` function call is greater than the ohmMinted. This might happen for early/first investor if the price of LP is increased and they would want to withdraw their Liquidity. 

## Vulnerability Detail

A user calls `withdraw` with the LP amount they want to burn and they would received the pairToken based on the amount of LP token. This LP token would be then used to calculate the amount of ohm tokens received and the pair tokens received. 

Following the the withdraw function:

```solidity
function withdraw(
        uint256 lpAmount_,
        uint256[] calldata minTokenAmounts_,
        bool claim_
    ) external onlyWhileActive nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
        // Liquidity vaults should always be built around a two token pool so we can assume
        // the array will always have two elements
        if (lpAmount_ == 0 || minTokenAmounts_[0] == 0 || minTokenAmounts_[1] == 0)
            revert LiquidityVault_InvalidParams();
        if (!_isPoolSafe()) revert LiquidityVault_PoolImbalanced();

        _withdrawUpdateRewardState(lpAmount_, claim_);

        totalLP -= lpAmount_;
        lpPositions[msg.sender] -= lpAmount_;

        // Withdraw OHM and pairToken from LP
        (uint256 ohmReceived, uint256 pairTokenReceived) = _withdraw(lpAmount_, minTokenAmounts_);

        // Reduce deposit values
        uint256 userDeposit = pairTokenDeposits[msg.sender];
        pairTokenDeposits[msg.sender] -= pairTokenReceived > userDeposit
            ? userDeposit
            : pairTokenReceived;
        ohmMinted -= ohmReceived > ohmMinted ? ohmMinted : ohmReceived;
        ohmRemoved += ohmReceived > ohmMinted ? ohmReceived - ohmMinted : 0;

        // Return assets
        _repay(ohmReceived);
        pairToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, pairTokenReceived);

        emit Withdraw(msg.sender, pairTokenReceived, ohmReceived);
        return pairTokenReceived;
    }
```

Assume a scenario where the first user deposits some LP token and the price of LPs increased. They would call `withdraw` for the withdrawal, which will call `_withdraw` internally. This function would return the ohmReceived value, and as the LP price is increased, the ohmReceived would be greater than the ohmMinted in the deposit call. 

In the above function the value of `ohmMinted` would now become 0. The value of `ohmRemoved` would be `ohmReceived` and the `_repay` would be called with the `ohmReceived` value. 

This `_repay` function would internally call `_burn` on `OlympusERC20` defined as follows:

```solidity
function _burn(address account, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
        require(account != address(0), "ERC20: burn from the zero address");

        _beforeTokenTransfer(account, address(0), amount);

        _balances[account] = _balances[account].sub(amount, "ERC20: burn amount exceeds balance");
        _totalSupply = _totalSupply.sub(amount);
        emit Transfer(account, address(0), amount);
    }
```

As the balances[vault] would be less than the `amount` because in the deposit call the minted value would be less than `ohmReceived` this subtraction would revert. 

## Impact

User would not be able to withdraw their tokens. The withdraw would work if the prices is dropped again or if other users deposit in the vault, this would create some loss for the user as they wanted to withdraw when the prices were in their favour.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

`_repay` should use the `ohmRemoved` value, as that is the actual value of ohm Removed.
