# VARIABLES CAN BE DECLARED OUTSIDE THE FOR LOOP TO SAVE GAS OF THE TRANSACTION

## Summary

In the `SingleSidedLiquidityVault` contract, there are multiple occasions where the variables are declared inside `for` loops. Since most of these for loops are unbounded it is required to save transaction gas during their execution to omit `denial of service` due to transaction gas running out.

## Vulnerability Detail

Inside the `_accumulateInternalRewards()` function the `uint256 totalRewards` is declared inside the for loop which is limited by an unbounded dynamic array `internalRewardTokens`. Hence gas is of high importance for the transaction execution. If the `internalRewardTokens` has high number of elements then the transaction could face `denial of service` due to transaction gas running out. Declaration of `uint256 totalRewards` inside the `for` loop does not help gas saving either. And there are multiple instances of this issue seen inside the `for` loops of this contract.

## Impact

The declaration of `uint256 totalRewards` at every iteration of the `for` loop will end up wasting transaction gas unnecessarily due to the requirement of memory allocation during each iteration of the `for` loop.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
        for (uint256 i; i < numInternalRewardTokens; ) {
            InternalRewardToken memory rewardToken = internalRewardTokens[i];

            uint256 totalRewards;
            if (totalLP > 0) {
                uint256 timeDiff = block.timestamp - rewardToken.lastRewardTime;
                totalRewards = (timeDiff * rewardToken.rewardsPerSecond);
            }
         ...
```

## Tool used

VS Code and Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to declare the variable outside the `for` loop and perform the variable value assignment inside the `for` loop. The recommended code snippet is given below:

```solidity
uint256 totalRewards;
        for (uint256 i; i < numInternalRewardTokens; ) {
            InternalRewardToken memory rewardToken = internalRewardTokens[i];

            if (totalLP > 0) {
                uint256 timeDiff = block.timestamp - rewardToken.lastRewardTime;
                totalRewards = (timeDiff * rewardToken.rewardsPerSecond);
            }
         ...
```
