# Oracles can't be replaced in case they fail

## Summary
The liquidity vault uses 3 oracles. Being the least reliable connected contracts, there should be an admin function to replace them in case they stop operating. Currently there is no way to do that.
## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
In case an oracle stops providing date the withdrawals and deposits will be halted and at the current state it can't be fixed short of replacing the whole vault contract.
## Code Snippet
Oracles in constructor

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add admin methods to the WstethLiquidityVault to replace the individual feeds.
