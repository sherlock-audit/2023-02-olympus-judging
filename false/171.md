# Contract is vulnerable to signature malleability because of Version used of ECDSA

## Summary

I understand that this issue is in File not in Scope, But It can be an issue of great value for Protocol so still reporting. 

The codebase uses lower version for its OpenZeppelin's dependency for `ECDSA`. This version has a High severity vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Detail

Impact of using this vulnerable version are described quite clearly in Issues section of Openzeppelin. It reads:

>The functions ECDSA.recover and ECDSA.tryRecover are vulnerable to a kind of signature malleability due to accepting EIP-2098 compact signatures in addition to the traditional 65 byte signature format. This is only an issue for the functions that take a single bytes argument, and not the functions that take r, v, s or r, vs as separate arguments.
The potentially affected contracts are those that implement signature reuse or replay protection by marking the signature itself as used rather than the signed message or a nonce included in it. A user may take a signature that has already been submitted, submit it again in a different form, and bypass this protection.

## Impact

Signature Replay Attacks possible in `OlympusERC20Token`.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
File: OlympusERC20.sol

    function tryRecover(bytes32 hash, bytes memory signature)
        internal
        pure
        returns (address, RecoverError)
    {
        // Check the signature length
        // - case 65: r,s,v signature (standard)
        // - case 64: r,vs signature (cf https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2098) _Available since v4.1._
        if (signature.length == 65) {
            bytes32 r;
            bytes32 s;
            uint8 v;
            // ecrecover takes the signature parameters, and the only way to get them
            // currently is to use assembly.
            assembly {
                r := mload(add(signature, 0x20))
                s := mload(add(signature, 0x40))
                v := byte(0, mload(add(signature, 0x60)))
            }
            return tryRecover(hash, v, r, s);
        } else if (signature.length == 64) {
            bytes32 r;
            bytes32 vs;
            // ecrecover takes the signature parameters, and the only way to get them
            // currently is to use assembly.
            assembly {
                r := mload(add(signature, 0x20))
                vs := mload(add(signature, 0x40))
            }
            return tryRecover(hash, r, vs);
        } else {
            return (address(0), RecoverError.InvalidSignatureLength);
        }
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend to use the latest safe version of OpenZeppelin library dependency for ECDSA (4.7.3).
