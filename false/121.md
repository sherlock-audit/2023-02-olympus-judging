# 0x00 in roles

## Summary
`ensureValidRole` function in `OlympusRoles.sol` fails to verify a role doesn't have a null byte (`0x00`)

## Vulnerability Detail
- A bug was found in the [ensureValidRole](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/modules/ROLES/OlympusRoles.sol#L72) function.
- The bug is that a role can have `0x00` in it, even though only the last char should be allowed to be `0x00`.
- This could cause problems when comparing roles or accessing them from a mapping.

## Impact
An invalid role may be created via the [saveRole](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/modules/ROLES/OlympusRoles.sol#L42) function, if a naive system monitors the roles created in may cause roles collision as roles will be terminated by the null byte in of the off-chain system. for example `0x61610061` and `0x61610062` may look the same as from the off-chain system both will appear as `0x6161`.

### NOTE
The impact may be high if other systems keep a state of the roles.

## Code Snippet
The buggy function is:

```solidity
function ensureValidRole(bytes32 role_) public pure override {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < 32; ) {
            bytes1 char = role_[i];
            if ((char < 0x61 || char > 0x7A) && char != 0x5f && char != 0x00) {
                revert ROLES_InvalidRole(role_); // a-z only
            }
            unchecked {
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
```

Notice the comment explains only a-z are allowed, while `0x00` will pass the check.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the `char != 0x00` check only on the last iteration
