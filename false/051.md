# No sanity checks on `changeUpdateThresholds` functions may cause the protocol to not work when updating to a very low value

## Summary
With no sanity checks on `changeUpdateThresholds`, zero or extremely low values to anyone of the `update threshold` value could not allow anyone to deposit or withdraw.


## Vulnerability Detail
We perform validation checks on the price feed data coming from chainlink, one of them being that if `updatedAt < block.timestamp - updateThreshold_`, then we would revert with `LiquidityVault_BadPriceFeed`. These validation checks are done while checking whether the pool safe to deposit or withdraw user funds. Since there no sanity checks in place here during updation of `UpdateThresholds` for each price feed, zero or an extremely low value can be set which can break deposit and withdraw functions

## Impact
If zero or extremely low values are set for `updateThreshold` for each price feed, validate price would always revert which would cause no one to be able to `deposit` into the protocol or `withdraw` their funds from the protocol

The `_isPoolSafe` function that uses `_valueProtocol`

Functions that can be affected that use the `_isPoolSafe` function:

In `deposit` function:

In `withdraw` function:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Please create common minimum threshold value of `updateThreshold` such that you cannot update these values below the specified threshold, thereby not allowing any zero or extremely low values for these parameters
