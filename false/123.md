# Zero Vault

## Summary
A vault with a zero address is able to be added.

## Vulnerability Detail
The [addVault](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/modules/LQREG/OlympusLiquidityRegistry.sol#L35) does not check if the vault address is `0x00` before adding it to the `activeVaults` array.

## Impact
This is problematic because `0x00` is not a valid vault address and could cause errors or security issues.


## Code Snippet
The buggy function is:

```solidity
function addVault(address vault_) external override permissioned {
        activeVaults.push(vault_);
        ++activeVaultCount;

        emit VaultAdded(vault_);
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review


## Recommendation
Add a check for 0x00 in the `addVault` function and revert if it is passed as an argument.
