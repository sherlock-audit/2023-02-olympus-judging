# CONDUCT THE `address(0)` CHECKS FOR PROTOCOL CRITICAL ADDRESS ASSIGNMENTS IN THE CONSTRUCTOR

## Summary

In the constructor of the `SingleSidedLiquidityVault` contract the `ohm` and `pairToken` cotracts are instantiated with the passed in address parameters for the respective contracts. But the passed in parameters are never checked for `address(0)`.

## Vulnerability Detail

`address(0)` can be passed in as address parameter erroneously. Since this is the constructor and only called ones during deployment of the contract, the `ohm` and `pairToken` contracts could be instantiated as zero address contracts which breaks the execution of the protocol. 

## Impact

If address(0) is passed in as input address parameter to either of `ohm` or `pairToken` contract, this will break the `SingleSidedLiquidityVault` contract execution and further will require redeployment of the `SingleSidedLiquidityVault` as a remedy, which could be costly in terms of gas. 

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    constructor(
        Kernel kernel_,
        address ohm_,
        address pairToken_,
        address liquidityPool_
    ) Policy(kernel_) {
        // Set tokens
        ohm = OlympusERC20Token(ohm_);
        pairToken = ERC20(pairToken_);
```

## Tool used

VS Code and Manual Review

## Recommendation

Perform address(0) checks for the critical address parameters passed into the constructor. The recommended change is shown in the below code snippet.

```solidity
    constructor(
        Kernel kernel_,
        address ohm_,
        address pairToken_,
        address liquidityPool_
    ) Policy(kernel_) {
        // Set tokens
        require(ohm_ != address(0), "Zero address is passed in");
        require(pairToken_ != address(0), "Zero address is passed in");
        ohm = OlympusERC20Token(ohm_);
        pairToken = ERC20(pairToken_);
```
