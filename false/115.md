# Reward tokens may be mistakenly registered multiple times.

## Summary

There are no guards deduping reward token registrations in the add token functions. Administrative mistakes may lead to tokens being registered multiple times and incorrect reward distributions.

## Vulnerability Detail

The add*Token functions in the SingleSidedLiquidityVault lack protection against administrative mistakes, such as adding a token multiple times. If this occurs for, say, an internal token then some users will get double rewards and others will get none at all.
