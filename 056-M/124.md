# setDebt frontrunning

## Summary
The function `setDebt` in `OlympusTreasury.sol` can be front run.

## Vulnerability Detail
The [setDebt](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/modules/TRSRY/OlympusTreasury.sol#L149)

## Impact
A user can avoid repaying some of their debt, thus stealing from the protocol.

### Demonstration
- `Bob` is allowed to take up a debt of `200`.
- `Bob` currently takes a debt of `100`.
-  For some reason, `setDebt` is called for `bob`, with the intention of lowering `Bob`'s debt by `60`.
- For example, because `Bob` paid for his debt through other means.
- To do that, `setDebt` is called with `100-60=40` as the new debt (the `amount` parameter).
- `Bob` monitors the transactions pool and notices the transaction, and decides to front-run it.
- `Bob` incurs more debt, to a total of `200` (as `Bob`'s allowed to).
- `setDebt(40)` is executed.
- `Bob`'s debt is decreased by 160, even though it was only meant to be decreased by 60, allowing `Bob` to avoid repaying `100`!


## Code Snippet
The buggy function is:

```solidity
function setDebt(
        address debtor_,
        ERC20 token_,
        uint256 amount_
    ) external override permissioned {
        uint256 oldDebt = reserveDebt[token_][debtor_];

        reserveDebt[token_][debtor_] = amount_;

        if (oldDebt < amount_) totalDebt[token_] += amount_ - oldDebt;
        else totalDebt[token_] -= oldDebt - amount_;

        emit DebtSet(token_, debtor_, amount_);
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Add an additional `currentDebt` parameter to the `setDebt` function.
- Alternatively, `setDebt` can be split into `increaseDebt` and `decreaseDebt`.
