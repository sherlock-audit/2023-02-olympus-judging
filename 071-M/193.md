# Withdrawals are dependent on admin actions

## Summary

In `SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol` we have function [withdraw()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L252). 
A user can only use this function when `onlyWhileActive` modifier is true. 

## Vulnerability Detail

`onlyWhileActive` modifier is controlled by the admin and so the admin can disable using the `withdrawa()`.  User should not be restricted from using the withdraw function because of admin.

## Impact

Admin can indefinitely disable withdrawal of user funds.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L252

```solidity
function withdraw(  
        uint256 lpAmount_,
        uint256[] calldata minTokenAmounts_,
        bool claim_
    ) external onlyWhileActive nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Withdrawals should never be paused because it affects the decentralization nature of the blockchain.
Remove `onlyWhileActive` modifier.
