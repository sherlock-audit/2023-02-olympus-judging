# freezing user rewards for a while

## Summary
When a user claims some cached rewards it's possible that rewards be freezed for a while . 
## Vulnerability Detail
the following line in internalRewardsForToken function can revert because already claimed rewards has been added to debt so if amount of debt be higher than accumulated rewards for user LP shares it will revert before counting cached rewards value so user should wait until earned rewards as much as last time he/she claimed rewards to be able claim it . 
`uint256 totalAccumulatedRewards = (lpPositions[user_] * accumulatedRewardsPerShare) - userRewardDebts[user_][rewardToken.token];`
## Impact
user rewards will be locked for a while

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add cached rewards to total rewards like the following line 
`uint256 totalAccumulatedRewards = (lpPositions[user_] * accumulatedRewardsPerShare + cachedUserRewards[user_][rewardToken.token] ) - userRewardDebts[user_][rewardToken.token];`
