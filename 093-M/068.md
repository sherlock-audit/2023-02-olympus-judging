# claiming internal rewards via `internalRewardsForToken` fails in some cases even when users are entitled to internal rewards

## Summary

Claiming internal rewards via `internalRewardsForToken` (in `SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol`) fails in some cases even when users are entitled to internal rewards. The code path starts from `claimRewards` and is possible due to a misplaced calculation.

## Vulnerability Detail

`claimRewards` calls `_claimInternalRewards` to get valid internal rewards for user. This function in turn, calls `internalRewardsForToken` to get the available amount to share.

Rewards are calculate by adding 2 sources:
1) accumulated rewards generated from having shares of the pools
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L355-L369
    - from the resulting amount itself it deducts the `userRewardDebts[user_][rewardToken.token]` value

2) rewards that have been accumulated but not claimed (`cachedUserRewards`)
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L371

The issue lies with `totalAccumulatedRewards` as in the way it's calculated causes, in some cases, a negative result, and since it is `uint256` results in an revert.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L368-L369

`totalAccumulatedRewards` is calculate as the gains from the users' LP positions (which increase over time) minus the considered user reward debt (which is increasable in other areas of the code). This way of calculating it allows for negative values to possibly appear.

## Impact

Users are left with internal rewards they are entitled to but cannot access without needing to further deposit liquidity into the pool or wait when they should have not.

## Code Snippet

POC that shows a normal user use case and revert follows (for `WstethLiquidityVaultMock.t`).
```Solidity
    function testCorrectness_internalRewardsRevertsOnSubtraction(address user_) public {
        
        vm.assume(user_ != address(0) && user_ != alice && user_ != address(liquidityVault));

        // Setup
        _withdrawTimeSetUp();

        // Add second depositor
        vm.startPrank(user_);
        wsteth.mint(user_, 1e18);
        wsteth.approve(address(liquidityVault), 1e18);
        liquidityVault.deposit(1e18, 1e18);
        vm.stopPrank();
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 10); // Increase time by 10 seconds

        // Trigger external rewards accumulation
        vm.prank(alice);
        liquidityVault.withdraw(1e18, minTokenAmounts_, false);

        // Alice's rewards should be 15 REWARD tokens _per claim_
        // 10 for the first 10 blocks and 5 for the second 10 blocks
        // User's rewards should be 5 REWARD tokens _per claim_

        // Verify initial state
        assertEq(reward.balanceOf(alice), 0);

        // normal user activity
        vm.prank(alice);
        liquidityVault.claimRewards();
        
        // simply checking the internalRewardsForToken function reverts 
        vm.expectRevert();
        liquidityVault.internalRewardsForToken(0, alice);    
        
        // user waits and want so claim again
        vm.expectRevert();
        vm.prank(alice);
        liquidityVault.claimRewards();
    }
```

## Recommendation

Move the problematic operations in the final calculation of the return statement
```Solidity
         }
 
         // This correctly uses 1e18 because the LP tokens of all major DEXs have 18 decimals
-        uint256 totalAccumulatedRewards = (lpPositions[user_] * accumulatedRewardsPerShare) -
-            userRewardDebts[user_][rewardToken.token];
-
-        return (cachedUserRewards[user_][rewardToken.token] + totalAccumulatedRewards) / 1e18;
+        return (cachedUserRewards[user_][rewardToken.token] + (lpPositions[user_] * accumulatedRewardsPerShare) -
+            userRewardDebts[user_][rewardToken.token]) / 1e18;
     }
```
or declare `totalAccumulatedRewards` as `int256`
