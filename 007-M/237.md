# UserRewardDebts set to 0 before usage

## Summary

User debt gets set to 0 too early. Causing too many rewards from being accounted to a user.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `SingleSidedLiquidityVault._withdrawUpdateRewardState` performs the following accounting:

```js
uint256 rewardDebtDiff = lpAmount_ * rewardToken.accumulatedRewardsPerShare;

if (rewardDebtDiff > userRewardDebts[msg.sender][rewardToken.token]) {
    userRewardDebts[msg.sender][rewardToken.token] = 0;
    cachedUserRewards[msg.sender][rewardToken.token] +=
        rewardDebtDiff -
        userRewardDebts[msg.sender][rewardToken.token];
```

The issue here is that `userRewardDebts` gets set to 0 before being subtracted from `cachedUserRewards`. This enables a user to claim rewards without having to payoff debt. A simple example to illustrate the issue:

- `rewardsPerSecond = 10`
- Alice deposits at `t = 0` and receives 10 shares
- Bob deposits at `t = 10` -> `accRewardsPerShare = 10` -> Bobs `userRewardDebt = 10*10 = 100`
- Bob withdraws everything at `t = 11` -> `accRewardsPerShare = 10 + (10/20) = 10.5` -> `rewardDebtDiff = 10*10.5 = 105`
    - `cachedUserRewards` should be `0 + 105 - 100 = 5` but is `0 + 105 - 0 = 105` instead 

## Impact

User does not need to pay off his debt, and hence gets too much rewards.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Perform `userRewardDebts[msg.sender][rewardToken.token] = 0;` after calculating the `cachedUserRewards`.
