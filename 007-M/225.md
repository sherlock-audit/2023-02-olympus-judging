# Incorrect update of `cachedUserRewards` breaks tracking of rewards, leading to users able to claim more than expected

## Summary
`_withdrawUpdateRewardState()` does not update `cachedUserRewards` properly, breaking the tracking of rewards and leading to users able to claim a higher amount than what they should.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `_withdrawUpdateRewardState()`, unclaimed rewards are pushed to `cachedUserRewards` so that they can be claimed later

```solidity
File: src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol
585:                 cachedUserRewards[msg.sender][rewardToken.token] +=
586:                     rewardDebtDiff -
587:                     userRewardDebts[msg.sender][rewardToken.token];
```

As `cachedUserRewards` is used in `internalRewardsForToken` to compute the rewards to be transferred to the caller

```solidity
File: src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol
371: return (cachedUserRewards[user_][rewardToken.token] + totalAccumulatedRewards) / 1e18;
```
```solidity
File: src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol
625:         uint256 reward = internalRewardsForToken(id_, msg.sender);
626:         uint256 fee = (reward * FEE) / PRECISION;
627: 
628:         userRewardDebts[msg.sender][rewardToken] += reward;
629:         accumulatedFees[rewardToken] += fee;
630: 
631:         if (reward > 0) ERC20(rewardToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, reward - fee);
```

The issue is that `userRewardDebts` is reset to `0` **before** it is deducted from `cachedUserRewards`:

```solidity
File: src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol
584:                 userRewardDebts[msg.sender][rewardToken.token] = 0;
585:                 cachedUserRewards[msg.sender][rewardToken.token] +=
586:                     rewardDebtDiff -
587:                     userRewardDebts[msg.sender][rewardToken.token]; //@audit this value is 0!
```

## Impact
`cachedUserRewards` is not properly updated, and ends up being much higher than what it should be (as it does not take into account `userRewardDebts` as expected), breaking rewards tracking and leading to users being able to claim a higher reward than they should in their next deposit/withdraw cycle.

Note than in this report, we looked at the internal rewards, but the exact same math issue is present for external rewards.
