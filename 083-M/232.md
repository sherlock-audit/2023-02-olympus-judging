# Deactivate removes vault from registry

## Summary

The `deactivate()` function of `SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol` removes the vault from the registry.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vault may still have outstanding OHM in pool, or relevant information that should be gathered by the registry for accounting. If it is removed, the UI processing information about vaults will provide non trustable information. 

## Impact

Broken accounting of OHM vault emitted / minted / burned tokens
