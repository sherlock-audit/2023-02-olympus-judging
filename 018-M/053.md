# Adding internal reward token could brick receiving rewards

## Summary

Without a sanity check for a new internal reward token, it can be an external reward token or duplicated.

## Vulnerability Detail

When adding a new internal reward token its lack of validation, should check either if the address was already set to an external reward token or if it is duplicated.

Adding a duplicated or external reward address can cause damage to the amount of reward distributed to users.

## Impact

When adding a duplicated token or an external reward token, the reward amount received by user can be counted incorrectly.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L674-L688

```solidity
function addInternalRewardToken(
  address token_,
  uint256 rewardsPerSecond_,
  uint256 startTimestamp_
) external onlyRole("liquidityvault_admin") {
  InternalRewardToken memory newInternalRewardToken = InternalRewardToken({
    token: token_,
    decimalsAdjustment: 10**ERC20(token_).decimals(),
    rewardsPerSecond: rewardsPerSecond_,
    lastRewardTime: block.timestamp > startTimestamp_ ? block.timestamp : startTimestamp_,
    accumulatedRewardsPerShare: 0
  });

  internalRewardTokens.push(newInternalRewardToken);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The fix is pretty straightforward, is recommended to  add checks to ensure the token:

1. Is not duplicated
2. Is not an external reward token
