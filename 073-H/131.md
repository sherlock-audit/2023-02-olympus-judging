# Attacker can claim way more internal rewards than they should.

## Summary
Attacker can call `claimRewards()` multiple times consecutively and keep claiming internal rewards while `timeDiff` remains the same, leading to user being able to claim as many rewards as he wants.

## Vulnerability Detail
`rewardToken.lastRewardTime` is used for calculating how much internal token rewards are owed since last time they have been claimed.

When calling `claimRewards()` -> `_claimInternalRewards()`, the function `internalRewardsForToken()` performs the calculations otherwise done by `_accumulateInternalRewards()` and `_updateInternalRewardState()`. 

However, `rewardToken.lastRewardTime` only gets updated in `_updateInternalRewardState()`, which is not called in `claimRewards()` function logic.
Therefore, `rewardToken.lastRewardTime` is not udpated. Same is also valid for `rewardToken.accumulatedRewardsPerShare`.

Consequently a user can call `claimRewards()` multiple times consecutively and keep claiming internal rewards while `timeDiff` remains the same, leading to user being able to claim as many rewards as he wants until
`uint256 totalAccumulatedRewards = (lpPositions[user_] * accumulatedRewardsPerShare) - userRewardDebts[user_][rewardToken.token];` reverts due to `userRewardDebts[msg.sender][rewardToken] += reward` state chnage in `_claimInternalRewards()`.

## Impact
Attacker can claim way more internal rewards than they should.

## Recommendation
Update `rewardToken.lastRewardTime` every time internal rewards are claimed.
