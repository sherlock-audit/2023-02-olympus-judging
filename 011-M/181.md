# Discrepency in getMaxDeposit and _canDeposit functions

## Summary

The public view function `getMaxDeposit()` to inform users about the max deposit they can do does match the internal function `_canDeposit()` that will actually revert if the deposit is too high.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `getMaxDeposit()` function calculates the OHM emitted as the number of OHM minted and not currently held in a pool and withdraw that from the `maxOhmAmount` that can be minted, which is used to compute the result.

The `_canDeposit()` function does not have such an`emitted` value.

## Impact

The `canDeposit()` function is called when depositing to limit the amount deposited, the `getMaxDeposit()` function probably serves the UI. The user is not properly informed of his deposit limit.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Make the function match / only use one calculus.
