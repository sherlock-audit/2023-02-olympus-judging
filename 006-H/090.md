# Flashloan attack to get lots of OHM at very low cost

## Summary
The ````deposit()```` and ````withdraw()```` logic is not implemented properly. Attackers can exploit them to get lots of OHM at very low cost by flashloan attack.

## Vulnerability Detail
First, let's set some realistic protocol parameters:
```solidity
File: src\policies\lending\abstracts\SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol
// 500k, from dev @Matt: 'LIMIT would be a few hundred k OHM'
108:     uint256 public LIMIT; 

// 2%, from dev@Matt 'THRESHOLD would be very close to the price update thresholds of the oracles'
// As chainlink's Deviation threshold for OHMv2/ETH pair is 2%, a reasonable threshold here should be not less than it
// https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/crypto-eth/ohmv2-eth
109:     uint256 public THRESHOLD; 
```
And the liquidity pool's parameters for ````OHM/wstETH```` is as follows
```solidity
File: src\test\policies\lending\WstethLiquidityVaultFork.t.sol
161:             uint256[] memory weights = new uint256[](2);
162:             weights[0] = 500000000000000000; // 50%
163:             weights[1] = 500000000000000000; // 50%
164: 
165:             liquidityPool = IBasePool(
166:                 weightedPoolFactory.create(
167:                     "50 OHM - 50 wstETH",
168:                     "OHM/wstETH",
169:                     tokens,
170:                     weights,
171:                     3000000000000000, // fee 0.3%
172:                     guardian
173:                 )
174:             );

```
Next let's given some market data, the data is simplified but not affect the exposition of the problem. Meanwhile, as swap fee is negligible, we ignore it too. The actual result will be slightly smaller than the calculation.
```solidity
priceOfwstETHUSDOracle = 1000
priceOfOHMUSDOracle = 10
priceOfOHMwstETHOracle = 0.01
priceOfOHMwstETHPool = 0.01

OHMInPool = 10,000 OHM
wstETHInPool = 100 wstETH
totalLPs = 1000

attackersBalanceOfwstETH = 49 wstETH
attackersBalanceValueInUSD = 49 * 1000 = 49000 USD
```

Now the attack begins
1. Flash loan 4900 wstETH from Balancer/Eulerwith fee free or AAVE with 0.09% fee (https://github.com/Jeiwan/flash-loans-comparison) and deposit it to ````WstethLiquidityVault````
```solidity
wstETHToDeposit = 4900 wstETH

// The WstethLiquidityVault contract uses oracle price to calculate OHM amount to deposit which is 0.01
OHMtoMint = 4900 / 0.01 = 490000 OHM

// add liquidity to the pool, then
OHMInPool = 10000 + 490000 = 500000 OHM
wstETHInPool = 100 + 4900 = 5000 wstETH
lpReceived = totalLPs  *  [(500000/10000)^0.5 * (5000/100)^0.5 - 1] = 1000 * 49 = 49000
totalLps = 1000 + 49000 = 50000
```

2. Buy ````4852```` OHM from the pool with ````49```` wstETH to make pool price increasing just a bit less than 2% ````THRESHOLD````
```solidity
SwapInwstETH = 49 wstETH
SwapOutOHM = 500000 * (1 - 5000/(5000 + 49)) = 4852.446 ≈ 4852 OHM
OHMInPool = 500000 - 4852 = 495148 OHM
wstETHInPool = 5000 + 49 = 5049 wstETH
priceOfOHMwstETHPool = 5049 / 495148 = 0.01019695 = 0.01 * 019695 < 0.01 * 0.02
```
Reference for how to calculate swap out based on given in https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/8f5fc628f350a0f403bb7f33972081ba26754dc4/pkg/pool-weighted/contracts/WeightedMath.sol#L85-L93

3. Withdraw all liquidity from ````WstethLiquidityVault```` contract
```solidity
wstETHWithdrawal = (lpReceived / totalLPs) * wstETHInPool = (49000 / 50000) * 5049 = 4948.02 ≈  4948 wstETH
OHMWithdrawalAndBurned =  (lpReceived / totalLPs) * OHMInPool =  (49000 / 50000) * 495148 = 485245 OHM
wstETHInPool = 5049 - 4948 = 101 wstETH
OHMInPool = 495148 - 485245 = 9903 OHM
```
4. Repay flash loan, then
```solidity
attackersBalanceOfOHM = 4852 OHM // swapOut in step 2
attackersBalanceOfwstETH = 4948 - 4900 = 48 wstETH
attackersCostOfwstETH = 49 - 48 = 1 wstETH
```
We can see the attacker get 4852 OHM by only cost 1 wstETH, get a 47520 profit in USD.
And in general, the profit rate in a single attack is about
```solidity
(LIMIT / initialOHMInPool) - 1
```

To make things even worse, the above attack can be repeated multiple times. Let's sell 97 OHM to the pool on base of ````step 3````
```solidity
SwapInOHM = 97 OHM
SwapOutwstETH = 101 * (1 - 9903/(9903 + 97)) = 0.9797 ≈ 0.98 wstETH
OHMInPool = 9903 + 97 = 10000 OHM
wstETHInPool = 101 - 0.98 = 100.02 wstETH
priceOfOHMwstETHPool = 100.02 / 100000 = 0.010002 = 0.01 * 1.0002
```
Now the pool price goes back to 0.01, we can repeat ````step 1 ~ 4```` to attack again.


## Impact
Attackers can get lots of OHM at very low cost.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Enforce users to repay enough OHM, if the OHM received from pool is insufficient, then buy back the difference OHM from pool by using their wstETH.
On the other hand, if received more OHM than borrowed, then sell the difference OHM to the pool and send the extra wstETH to users too.
