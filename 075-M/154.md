# [M-01] Pool price in Balancer Pool can be miscalculated

## Summary

The pool price is calculated by the OHM/wstETH ratio of the Balancer pool, which reflects the value distribution of the tokens in the pool. However, to calculate the price accurately, the weight of each token should also be considered, as it affects how much each token contributes to the pool's total value


## Vulnerability Details

In WstethLiquidityVault, the pool price is calculated as following:
        `(balances_[0] * 1e18) / balances_[1]`

However the price should be calculated as spot price which is the the ratio of the token balances normalized by their weights:

## Impact

Incorrect pool price can cause depositing and withdrawing to be suspended. This is because the pool price is compared with the price from Oracle to check if the Vault is secure. The wrong calculation can also increase the risk of impermanent loss

## Recommendation

Apply official formula by Balancer Protocol when calculating the spot price
