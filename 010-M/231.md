# CachedUserRewards and UserRewardsDebts not reset when exiting position

## Summary

The variables `cachedUserRewards` and `userRewardDebts` are not reset to 0 after withdrawing all LPs and claiming all Rewards. Requiring the user to accrue as many rewards as he has debt the next time he deposits.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `_claimInternalRewards` sets the value of `userRewardDebts` to the following value:

```js
uint256 reward = internalRewardsForToken(id_, msg.sender);
...
userRewardDebts[msg.sender][rewardToken] += reward;
```

With the calculation of `internalRewardsForToken` looking like this:

```js
uint256 totalAccumulatedRewards = (lpPositions[user_] * accumulatedRewardsPerShare) -
    userRewardDebts[user_][rewardToken.token];

return (cachedUserRewards[user_][rewardToken.token] + totalAccumulatedRewards) / 1e18;
```

Now imagine the user has accrued 1000 reward tokens after withdrawing all his LP and claiming afterwards, then `userRewardsDebts = 1000` and `cachedUserRewards = 1000`. When he deposits liquidity the next time, he will not be able to claim his reward tokens until he has accrued at least 1000 reward tokens, due to the underflow of this line: 

```js
uint256 totalAccumulatedRewards = (lpPositions[user_] * accumulatedRewardsPerShare) -
    userRewardDebts[user_][rewardToken.token];
```

## Impact

DOS of rewards claiming, when user withdraws from the pool and redeposits later on. Possibly permanent, if reward token gets removed, while user waits for accrual of enough tokens.

same issue applies to external reward token loops

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

When claiming, reduce `cachedUserRewards` to 0 and increase `userRewardsDebts` only by the value of `totalAccumulatedRewards`. (this will reduce `userRewardsDebts` whenever user withdraws LP)
