# [M] - The setFee function can set the reward fee to 100%, causing the user's entire reward to be taken as the fee.

## Summary
The `setFee` function in the `SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol` file is used to set a fee when people claim their rewards. The fee can be set by the an admin and it can be anything from 0 to 100%.
If the fee is set to 100% then the user won't get any rewards and everything would be added to the fee.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `setFee` function can only be called by someone with a `liquidityvault_admin` role. However, it lacks a limit check which enables the admin to set it to any value between 0 and 100%. 
Eventhough this is a centralization risk, It's better to implement a simple check that limits the fee to be set within a particular range.

## Impact
If the fee is set to 100%, no rewards will be sent to the users and everything will be accumulated in the FEE variable

## Tool used
Manual review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a limit where the fee can only be less than or equal to 10%
Something like the below would work
```solidity
error Fee_Too_High();

function setFee(uint256 fee_) external onlyRole("liquidityvault_admin") {
				if(fee_ > 100) revert Fee_Too_High();
        FEE = fee_;
    }
```
