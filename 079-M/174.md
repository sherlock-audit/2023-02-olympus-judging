# Vauly may lock itself in unusable state due to outdated pool price

## Summary

The vault uses `_isPoolSafe()` function that checks whether the pool price is `THRESHOLD` away from the oracle price and prevents withdraw / deposits if it is.

## Vulnerability Detail

If the pool bound to the vault is only used by the `SingleSidedLiquidityVault`, the pool price may differ from the oracle and lock the vault in a state where users cannot deposit or more importantly withdraw.

## Impact

Users cannot withdraw their funds.

## Code Snippet

`withdraw()` in `SingleSidedLiquidityVault`, calls `_isPoolSafe()`

`_isPoolSafe()` uses oracle and threshold:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Allow withdrawal of funds independently of pool price using solely price oracle to determine user payout.
