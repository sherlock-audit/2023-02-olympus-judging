# Fee upper boundary

## Summary

The `FEE` variable is unbounded thus any change can instantly negatively impact users.

## Vulnerability Detail

The fee can be changed anytime to any value up to 100%:
```solidity
    function setFee(uint256 fee_) external onlyRole("liquidityvault_admin") {
        if (fee_ > PRECISION) revert LiquidityVault_InvalidParams();
        FEE = fee_;
    }
```
The change will immediately take action and all the pending claims (in the mempool) will have this new value applied even though the fee might have been lower when users initiated transactions.

## Impact

It is unfair from the users' perspective that the fee can be changed anytime to any value. Users have no opportunity to reject if their transaction is mined between the changes.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Introduce a reasonable upper limit for the fee variable, e.g. max 20%,  or the users should have a parameter to specify max accepted fee (similar to slippage).
