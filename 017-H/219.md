# Incorrect reward tracking / calculation

## Summary

The function that calculates the amount of reward token to receive `internalRewardsForToken()` divides the end result by `10**18` which is inconsistent with how the result is treated.

## Vulnerability Detail

The result returned by `internalRewardsForToken()` is `(cachedUserRewards[user_][rewardToken.token] + (lpPositions[user_] * accumulatedRewardsPerShare) - userRewardDebts[user_][rewardToken.token]) / 1e18`. The lp token uses 18 decimals and `accumulatedRewardsPerShare` is expressed in power of 18 as suggested by `accumulatedRewardsPerShare += (totalRewards * 1e18) / totalLP`.

This result is used by `_claimInternalRewards` which adds it to `userRewardDebts[msg.sender][rewardToken]`. The values of `userRewardDebts` and `cachedUserRewards` are then transferred from one to the other in `_withdrawUpdateRewardState` under certain circumstances (line 585), which means they should have the same dimension (in terms of power of 10).

However, as we saw the value of `cachedUserRewards` for the user is divided by `1e18` in the calculation above, which means they cannot have the same dimension.

Additionally the amount of tokens transferred by `_claimInternalRewards()` should take into account the full cache and not `cachedUserRewards / 1e18`

## Impact

The cached user reward have almost no impact on the reward token that should be withdrawn by the user. The users will receive less reward token than they should if they use the cache and do not withdraw their rewards on each withdraw from the vault.

## Code Snippet

internalRewardsForToken divides the whole result by `10**18`:

It is used in _claimInternalRewards:

cachedUserRewards and userRewardDebts should be comparable:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Move the division by 10**18.

```diff 
    function internalRewardsForToken(uint256 id_, address user_) public view returns (uint256) {
        InternalRewardToken memory rewardToken = internalRewardTokens[id_];
        uint256 lastRewardTime = rewardToken.lastRewardTime;
        uint256 accumulatedRewardsPerShare = rewardToken.accumulatedRewardsPerShare;

        if (block.timestamp > lastRewardTime && totalLP != 0) {
            uint256 timeDiff = block.timestamp - lastRewardTime;
            uint256 totalRewards = timeDiff * rewardToken.rewardsPerSecond;

            // This correctly uses 1e18 because the LP tokens of all major DEXs have 18 decimals
            accumulatedRewardsPerShare += (totalRewards * 1e18) / totalLP;
        }

        // This correctly uses 1e18 because the LP tokens of all major DEXs have 18 decimals
+        uint256 totalAccumulatedRewards = (lpPositions[user_] * accumulatedRewardsPerShare)  / 1e18 -
+            userRewardDebts[user_][rewardToken.token];
+
+        return cachedUserRewards[user_][rewardToken.token] + totalAccumulatedRewards

-        uint256 totalAccumulatedRewards = (lpPositions[user_] * accumulatedRewardsPerShare) -
-            userRewardDebts[user_][rewardToken.token];
-
-        return (cachedUserRewards[user_][rewardToken.token] + totalAccumulatedRewards) / 1e18;
```
