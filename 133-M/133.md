# `pairToken` with 24 decimals is not supported.

## Summary
`pairToken` with 24 decimals is not supported.
- decimalAdjustment = 18 + 8 + 9 - 8 - `24` = 3

## Vulnerability Detail

"high quality tokens like major liquid staking derivatives or stablecoins" don't usually have 24 decimals.

However, if in the future SSVL wants to integrate with tokens with 24 decimals the `_valueCollateral()` function will no work due to the extra decimals.
1 ohm will be returned as 1000.

As crypto is ever-changing it could be wise to develop a method that can handle any amount of token decimals for future proofing.
