# Potential array manipulation vulnerabilities in removeVault function

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/modules/LQREG/OlympusLiquidityRegistry.sol#L43

## Summary

`removeVault` function  removes a vault from an array by swapping the last element with the removed element and then popping the last element, potentially changing the array order and causing issues if other parts of the contract rely on the array order. This way may also be vulnerable to integer overflow or underflow attacks.


## Vulnerability Detail
Assume, `activeVaults` array contains the following addresses 
in the given order: 
`[A, B, C, D, E ]`

If `removeVault` is called to remove address `C`, 

the function will swap `C `with the last element `E`, 

resulting in the array `[A, B, E, D, C]`. 

The last element `C` is then popped off the array, 

resulting in the final array `[A, B, E, D]`.

If another function relied on the original order of the array and expected address `C` to be in the third position, it would not work as intended with the modified array. 

Additionally, if `activeVaultCount` was not properly checked before decrementing, it could result in an underflow error if the count is already zero.


## Impact
This could cause the contract to revert or behave unexpectedly.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

### Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. Use a mapping instead of an array.
2. Add a proper checker to check `activeVaultCount` before decrementing.
