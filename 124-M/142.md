# `_hasDeposited` remains true after a user withdraws causing state changes to occur on a user who has withdrawn

## Summary
When a user deposits to the protocol, they are added to the state variable `_hasDeposited` for the purposes of migration and other changes which may be required in the `SingleSidedLiquidityVault` however, this value is not updated when a user has withdrawn from the system. 

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user has withdrawn from the system by calling the `withdraw()` function, there is no update on their `_hasDeposited` status which should be `false`.

## Impact
Should the protocol team need to make necessary changes to the system or migrate the state to other contracts, there may be conflicts for users who have already withdrawn and users who are actively staking in the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend updating the `_hasDeposited` status for users who are totally withdrawn from the protocol (zero in LP) to `false` when calling the `withdraw()` function.
