# configureDependencies fails to remove allowance from an old MINTR

## Summary
``configureDependencies()`` might reconfigure its TRSRY,  TRSRYv1, and  MINTR, in this case, it needs to remove the allowance from the old MINTR before its approve allowance to the new MINTR. However, ``configureDependencies()``  leaves the infinite allowance to the obsolte MINTR, leaving it for future exploit if the old MINTR is compromised. 


## Vulnerability Detail
``configureDependencies()`` might reconfigure its TRSRY,  TRSRYv1, and  MINTR, in this case, it needs to remove the allowance from the old MINTR before it approves allowance to the new MINTR.

However,  the above code simply gives the allowance to the new MINTR, without removing the existing allowance from the old MINTR (if there is one). 

## Impact
 ``configureDependencies()``  leaves the infinite allowance to the obsolte MINTR, leaving it for future exploit if the old MINTR is compromised. 

## Code Snippet
See above

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We will remove the allowance from the old MINTR first before reconfiguration.
```diff
function configureDependencies() external override returns (Keycode[] memory dependencies) {
+     if(MINTR != address(0)) ohm.safeApprove(address(MINTR), 0); // @audit: remove old allowance

        dependencies = new Keycode[](3);
        dependencies[0] = toKeycode("TRSRY");
        dependencies[1] = toKeycode("MINTR");
        dependencies[2] = toKeycode("ROLES");

        TRSRY = TRSRYv1(getModuleAddress(dependencies[0]));
        MINTR = MINTRv1(getModuleAddress(dependencies[1]));
        ROLES = ROLESv1(getModuleAddress(dependencies[2]));

        // Approve MINTR for burning OHM (called here so that it is re-approved on updates)
        ohm.safeApprove(address(MINTR), type(uint256).max);
    }
```
