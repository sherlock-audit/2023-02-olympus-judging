# Adding reward token with future timestamp may break vault

## Summary

The vault has the possibility to add internal reward token with a timestamp in the future. Doing so will make accumulation of internal rewards fail due to underflow.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function to accumulate internal rewards calculates `uint256 timeDiff = block.timestamp - rewardToken.lastRewardTime;` which will revert if `rewardToken.lastRewardTime` is in the future.

This function is called in `_depositUpdateRewardState()` which is called among the first steps of `deposit()` and in `_withdrawUpdateRewardState` called among the first steps of `withdraw()`. 

## Impact

Adding an internal token with a timestamp in the future will lock the vault until that timestamp is reached or the reward token is removed.

## Code Snippet

addInternalRewardToken allows lastRewardTime to be in the future:

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check for future timestamp and assign a reward of 0.
