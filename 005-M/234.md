# If a reward token is added with distribution starting in the future, the vault is broken until that point.

## Summary
Adding a reward token with `lastRewardTime > block.timestamp` breaks the vault until `lastRewardTime` is reached.

## Vulnerability Detail
When adding a reward token, `lastRewardTime` is set to be `startTimestamp_` if `startTimestamp_ > block.timestamp`.

This will cause to a revert with underflow in `_accumulateInternalRewards()` line 472, until `startTimestamp_` is reached:

```solidity
File: src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol
471:             if (totalLP > 0) {
472:                 uint256 timeDiff = block.timestamp - rewardToken.lastRewardTime;
473:                 totalRewards = (timeDiff * rewardToken.rewardsPerSecond);
474:             }
```

As both `_depositUpdateRewardState` and `_withdrawUpdateRewardState` loop through all reward tokens (calling `_accumulateInternalRewards()`), this means deposits and withdrawals are essentially paused until `lastRewardTime`.

## Impact
Unexpected pause of the vault.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If you wish to authorize distribution of rewards starting in the future for some tokens, ensure you make the following change:

```diff
File: src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol
471:             if (totalLP > 0) {
-472:                 uint256 timeDiff = block.timestamp - rewardToken.lastRewardTime;
+472:                 uint256 timeDiff = block.timestamp >= rewardToken.lastRewardTime ? block.timestamp - rewardToken.lastRewardTime : 0;
473:                 totalRewards = (timeDiff * rewardToken.rewardsPerSecond);
474:             }
```
