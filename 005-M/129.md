# Adding an internal reward token that begins accrual at a future time will DOS the entire vault

## Summary

SingleSidedLiquidityVault#addInternalRewardToken allows adding a token that begins accrual a later time. The issues with this is that it sets the lastRewardTime to a time that is greater than block.timestamp. This causes an underflow in _accumulateInternalRewards which will DOS the vault until the the start of accrual.

SingleSidedLiquidityVault#addInternalRewardToken allows adding a token that begins accrual at a time later than block.timestamp by setting lastRewardTime to the desired time to being accrual.

When an internal reward token has a lastRewardTime this is greater than block.timestamp L472 will underflow and revert. The effect of this is that _accumulateInternalRewards will now constantly revert until the token begins accruing interest. This is problematic as both deposit and withdraw make a subcall to this function resulting in both functions being DOS'd.

## Impact

Vault will be DOS'd until internal reward token begins accruing

## Recommendation
