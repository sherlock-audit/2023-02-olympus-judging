# adding new internal reward token can block deposit and withdraw

## Summary
adding new internal reward token with _startTimeStamp higher than block.timestamp blocks deposit and withdraws .
## Vulnerability Detail
The _accumulateInternalRewards function always during deposit and withdraw called by pre-post deposit and withdraw hooks and if lastRewardTime of a internal token be after block.timestamp the following line of code in _accumulateInternalRewards will revert resulting reverting whole transaction.  
`uint256 timeDiff = block.timestamp - rewardToken.lastRewardTime;`
## Impact
blocking deposit and withdraws .
