# adding new internal reward token can lock some functionalities

## Summary
If admin add an internal reward token with startTimestamp_ (The timestamp at which to start distributing rewards) of higher than block.timestamp the deposit and withdraw functionalities will be locked until startTimestamp_  arrives or admin removes the token . 
## Vulnerability Detail
lastRewardTime is larger than block.timestamp so the following line in _accumulateInternalRewards function will cause reverting transaction , since this function called during deposit and withdraw these functions will be locked until the lastRewardTime arrives or admin removes the token . 
`uint256 timeDiff = block.timestamp - rewardToken.lastRewardTime;`
## Impact
withdraw and deposit functions will be locked and freezing funds for a while .
