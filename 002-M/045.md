# When reward token is being removed it should send rewards to users

## Summary
When reward token is being removed it should send rewards to users.
## Vulnerability Detail
SingleSidedLiquidityVault uses reward tokens that pays users during the time.
Admin [can remove reward token](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L694-L703) any time which will make impossible for users to claim their rewards later as this token is not in the list anymore.

As result users will lost their rewards if removing will happen when token already accrued some rewards.
## Impact
User lose their rewards.
