# User rewards will be lost when a reward token is removed from the protocol

## Summary
The `SingleSidedLiquidityVault` allows for guardians of the Olympus protocol to initialize the vault by adding both internal and external rewards tokens for the purposes of rewarding users for their staking tokens over a period of time. Alternatively, when the protocol wishes to deprecate reward tokens they may remove them as well which may cause an impact to the already accumulated rewards for the users. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Should the guadian decide to remove a reward token from the protocol, the `removeInternalRewardToken()` and `removeExternalRewardToken()` does not check if there are still rewards locked up for users awaiting to be claimed. As a result, a removed reward token could mean a loss of rewards no matter how long users have been staking for. 


## Impact
This was rated a medium in severity because this requires the admin user to deprecate reward tokens (accidentally or intentionally) from the protocol - should reward tokens be removed, this will result in the loss of funds for staked users. The proof of concept below outlines this scenario:


*Proof of Concept*
```solidity

    function testUserFundsAreLost() public {


        // Setup scenario
        SingleSidedLiquidityVault.InternalRewardToken[] memory internalRewards = liquidityVault.getInternalRewardTokens();
        ERC20 lidoRewards = ERC20(address(internalRewards[0].token)); // LIDO DAO Governance Token


        // Begin scenario - alice stakes in the vault
        vm.startPrank(address(alice));
        wsteth.approve(address(liquidityVault), 1 ether);
        liquidityVault.deposit(1 ether, 100);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Move timestamp forward to allow for rewards accumulation
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 2 days);
        
        // Guardian removes a token from the vault
        vm.startPrank(address(guardian));
        liquidityVault.removeInternalRewardToken(0, address(lidoRewards));
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Alice's claim rewards silently fails
        vm.startPrank(address(alice));
        liquidityVault.claimRewards();
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Assert that no rewards were collected
        // Alice is supposed to have 518 claimable rewards.
        assertEq(lidoRewards.balanceOf(address(alice)), 0); 


    }

```

## Recommendation

I recommend paying out all user rewards on token deletion using the `lpPositions` and `users` storage variables or reverting if there are still outstanding tokens yet to be claimed.
