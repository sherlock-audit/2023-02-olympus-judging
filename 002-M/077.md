# Admin removing rewardtoken issues no warning to users

## Summary
The functions removeExternalRewardToken and removeInternalRewardToken gives an admin the privilege to remove a token from either the internalRewardtoken array or the externalRewardtoken array. This is perhaps a safety mechanism, but the function does not emit an event, nor does it give users time to claim rewards on that token. Regardless of what the admin's intentions are, users stand to lose funds in this manner.

## Vulnerability Detail
Here we have the function removeExternalRewardToken

There is no event emitted for this function nor is there any time to react, so if an admin calls this function and then a user tries to receive his rewards by calling claimrewards, the user will receive less rewards than anticipated shown here

## Impact
Users will lose rewards due to no time for users to react.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Emit an event and also provide some lag time for users to claims rewards on a token before an admin removes them
