# Any unclaimed rewards will be lost when the admin removes a reward token

## Summary
The admin is allowed to remove reward tokens. If they do it, any unclaimed rewards will be lost.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a reward token is removed the contract doesn't distribute the remaining rewards to existing shareholders. Instead, any unclaimed yield is lost.

This leaves us with two scenarios:
1. admin doesn't care and just removes the reward tokens. Users lose rewards.
2. admin can't execute the removal because there's realistically no timing where all the rewards are claimed.

## Impact
If the admin removes a reward token unclaimed rewards are lost.

## Code Snippet
The struct that is removed contains data needed to distribute tokens, e.g. `accumulatedRewardsPerShare` and `lastRewardTime`. Even if the token is added back at a later time, the previous rewards won't be claimable because those values were reset.

        external
        onlyRole("liquidityvault_admin")
    {
        if (externalRewardTokens[id_].token != token_) revert LiquidityVault_InvalidRemoval();

        // Delete reward token from array by swapping with the last element and popping
        externalRewardTokens[id_] = externalRewardTokens[externalRewardTokens.length - 1];
        externalRewardTokens.pop();
    }

    function removeInternalRewardToken(uint256 id_, address token_)
        external
        onlyRole("liquidityvault_admin")
    {
        if (internalRewardTokens[id_].token != token_) revert LiquidityVault_InvalidRemoval();

        // Delete reward token from array by swapping with the last element and popping
        internalRewardTokens[id_] = internalRewardTokens[internalRewardTokens.length - 1];
        internalRewardTokens.pop();
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
For internal tokens, the `removeInternalRewardToken()` should call `_accumulateInternalReward()`. Then, it should set the `rewardsPerSecond` to `0`. That way, no new tokens will be distributed. But, all the rewards generated until the time of the removal can still be claimed.

For external tokens, there is no easy way to remove them gracefully. I think you would need to redesign the contract for that.
