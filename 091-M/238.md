# liquidityvault_admin can rug pull the vault by calling `deactivate()` and then `rescueToken()`

## Summary

Currently the liquidityvault_admin is responsinble for both setting the `isVaultActive` flag and withdrawing tokens from the contract in an emergency situation.

## Vulnerability Detail

At the moment the check for `if (isVaultActive) revert LiquidityVault_StillActive();` in `rescueToken()` is useless since it set by the liquidityvault_admin and `rescueToken()` is callable only by the same account. This means that liquidityvault_admin can steal all tokens from the vault at any time and users have to rely on him for returning their funds. This is a serious centralisation issue and is not decentralised at all.

## Impact

liquidityvault_admin can rug pull any vault.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    /// @notice                   Transfers tokens from the contract to the admin
    /// @param  token_            The address of the token to transfer
    /// @param  amount_           The amount of tokens to transfer
    /// @dev                      This function can only be accessed by the liquidityvault_admin role and only when
    ///                           the vault is deactivated. This acts as an emergency migration function in the event
    ///                           that the vault is compromised.
    function rescueToken(address token_, uint256 amount_)
        external
        onlyRole("liquidityvault_admin")
    {
        if (isVaultActive) revert LiquidityVault_StillActive();
        ERC20(token_).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount_);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement the withdrawal pattern for rescuing tokens and let every user to withdraw their tokens themselves instead of relying on a single entity that control both the vault pausing and token withdrawal.
