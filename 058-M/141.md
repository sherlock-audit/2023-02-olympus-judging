# Minimum tokens out not enforced when withdrawing from external contracts which can cause slippage during market turbulance

## Summary
The `withdraw()` function of the `SingleSidedLiquidityVault` contract allows users to withdraw tokens they initially deposited into the vault. This function takes in the number of LPTokens the user wishes to withdtaw, the min out tokens as a uint array and an option on whether they want to claim rewards or not as represented by a bool however, the min out tokens are not enforced by the vault. Additionally, if the vault is to integrate with other protocols it should try not rely on external sources to check the min amount out as some may not do so. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Because min out tokens are not enforced when the user attempts to withdraw (and may not be enforced in the external protocol), during market turbulance this may cause the user to receive less tokens than they had initially thought. 

## Impact
This may also open the user up to frontrunning attacks when attempting to withdraw from an external smart contract. This was marked as a Medium in severity because while the current protocols may be doing slippage checks, should Olympus decide to add other protocols to the vault, it should not rely on external smart contracts to perform slippage checks.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It's recommended that the withdraw function asserts that the min tokens out for BOTH OHM and pairTokens are enforced against `minTokenAmounts_` when `_withdraw` is called.
