# user rewards can be locked for sometime

## Summary
user rewards can be locked if user claims some cached rewards until earn rewards as much as cached rewards . 
## Vulnerability Detail
when a user claims some cached rewards has been added to user debt, this increasing of debts cause user not to be able claim rewards until claimable rewards reach debt (cached rewards should deducted from debt). all of this happens because the following line reverts because debt is larger than claimable rewards and can't be deducted so cached rewards should be count to prevent this.
`uint256 totalAccumulatedRewards = (lpPositions[user_] * accumulatedRewardsPerShare) - userRewardDebts[user_][rewardToken.token];`
## Impact
user can't claim his rewards.
