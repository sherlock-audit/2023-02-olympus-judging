# `getUsers()` will always be reverted if the length is too big

## Summary

`getUsers()` will always be reverted if the length is too big, the migration will always be reverted.

## Vulnerability Detail

From [README.md](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus-rayn731#emergency-process):
> These LPs can be migrated to a new implementation contract and we can seed the `lpPositions` state through a combination of calling `getUsers` and then getting the `lpPositions` value for each user

```solidity
    address[] public users; // Used to track users that have interacted with this contract (for migration in the event of a bug)
```

But if the users array is too big, `getUsers()` will be reverted, or the migration contract will run out of gas if it iterates all users and always be reverted.

## Impact

The migration will always revert.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add pagination in `getUsers`, for example `getUsers(uint start, uint stop)`.
Or use a `current` length pointer of `users` array for migration.
