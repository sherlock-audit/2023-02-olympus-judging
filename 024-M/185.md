# Unbounded array in `SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol`

# Unbounded array in `SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol`

## Summary

In `SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol` we have [deposit()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L187) function. When a new user makes a deposit, it is added to the `users` array. The problem here is that this users array is unbounded and this may cause problems in the future.

## Vulnerability Detail

See Summary

## Impact
It is possible that a malicious person deliberately can cause a DOS, by deliberately increasing the array or just the array by itself become too big in the future.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L197
```solidity
92: address[] public users; // Used to track users that have interacted with this contract (for migration in the event of a bug)

197: users.push(msg.sender);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add upper bound on `users` array.
