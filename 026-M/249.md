# Double-dipping of internal rewards

## Summary
`claimRewards()` does not update the state of internal rewards, leading to users able to double dip on rewards claim
 
## Vulnerability Detail
`claimRewards()` claims internal rewards, but does not call `_updateInternalRewardState()`, meaning `rewardToken.lastRewardTime` is not updated.

As `rewardToken.lastRewardTime` is used to compute the rewards a user should receive, not updating it means a user can double dip on rewards:

e.g:
Simple case where there is one internal reward token
Alice deposits on block 1000 (the amounts do not matter): `rewardToken.lastRewardTime == 1000`
- she claims on block 2000. `rewardToken.lastRewardTime` is not updated
- she withdraws on block 3000. `rewardToken.lastRewardTime == 1000` is used to compute her rewards, leading her to get rewards from block 1000 to 2000 for the second time.

## Impact
Users are able to claim more rewards than what they should
