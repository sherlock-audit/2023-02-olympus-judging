# Internal state not updated during `claimRewards` call

## Summary
The internal state is updated, and the accumulated reward per share is updated in the function `_updateInternalRewardState` in `SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol`. This is done for deposits and withdraws, but is missing for `claimRewards` calls. Since this function updates and sets the latest value for `accumulatedRewardsPerShare`, it sets the incorrect `userRewardDebt` value.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `userRewardDebt` quantity tracks the `lpAmount*accumulatedRewardsPerShare` quantity, which is important to track the amounts of rewards the user cannot access/ paid out before the user joined. This quantity requires an updated value of `accumulatedRewardsPerShare` for each token to be present for every state change (deposit, withdraw, claim). This `accumulatedRewardsPerShare` for each token is updated in the function `_updateInternalRewardState`, which is never called during the `climRewards` call as can be seen below

The external reward handling function correctly updates the reward ratio, but the internal rewards mechanism fails to do so.
## Impact
Incorrect reward calculation

## Recommendation
Call `_updateInternalRewardState` before calculating internal rewards
