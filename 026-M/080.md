# ClaimRewards does not updateInternalRewardToken

## Summary
The function claimrewards allows a user who has deposit funds to receive rewards. The function does an internal check to calculate rewards for externaltokens by calling   _updateExternalRewardState shown here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L302-L304

 but does not do the same for internal tokens shown here 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/lending/abstracts/SingleSidedLiquidityVault.sol#L294-L296.

 This can result in an incorrect reward amount for users. when they call claimrewards.
