# internalRewardsForToken divides before multiplying and there is loss of precision for user rewards

## Summary

`internalRewardsForToken` divides before multiplying and there is loss of precision for user rewards

## Vulnerability Detail

In `internalRewardsForToken`, the project first calls `accumulatedRewardsPerShare += (totalRewards * 1e18) / totalLP;`. In the end of the function, it returns with another division with the previously calculated value: `return (cachedUserRewards[user_][rewardToken.token] + totalAccumulatedRewards) / 1e18;`

These two divisions cause the the precision loss for user rewardtokens.

It can be verified with this PoC, where 10 OHM reward tokens are added to the vault. There is only 1 user who should receive all rewards. However, this user doesn't receive the full 10 OHM, but instead 13 wei less than the full amount.

```solidity
function testUserReceivesFullRewards() public {
  vm.prank(guardian);
  liquidityVault.addInternalRewardToken(address(ohm), 1e9, block.timestamp); // 1 OHM token per second
  deal(address(ohm), address(liquidityVault), 10e9);
  
  vm.prank(alice);
  liquidityVault.deposit(WSTETH_AMOUNT, 0);
  vm.warp(block.timestamp + 10); // Increase time 10 seconds so there are 10 ohm token rewards for Alice

  vm.prank(alice);
  liquidityVault.claimRewards();

	console2.log("Alice's rewards", ohm.balanceOf(alice));
}

├─ [0] console::log(Alice's rewards, 9999999987) [staticcall]
```

## Impact

User receives less reward tokens than she should receive. 

Another problem with this precision loss is that the protocol is accounted for less fees. This means that some tokens are left in the contract that are unaccounted for.

## Recommendation

Move these 2 divisions into a single equation where you divide only once.
